		<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/allthingsd.com/files/2013/07/Charles_Huang-229x285.jpeg?resize=229%2C285" alt="Charles_Huang" data-recalc-dims="1"/>As the co-founder of RedOctane (later purchased and closed by Activision), Charles Huang helped oversee Guitar Hero’s release into stores and then living rooms worldwide. The <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Guitar_Hero_series_controllers.jpg">plastic guitar controllers</a> from that series were iconic for a time, but now Huang has moved on to something completely different. Along with two former Palm employees, he’s the co-founder of <a href="http://greenthrottle.com/">Green Throttle Games</a>, which makes a handful of compatible Android games <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130425/green-throttle-takes-a-few-mobile-games-to-the-living-room/">playable on the TV</a>.</p>
<p>Below, Huang answers 14 of our questions.</p>
<p><strong>Whom do you idolize?</strong><br/>
Bruce Lee. Bruce almost single-handedly made Asian men tough in the eyes of the world. I think even to this day, he may be the most recognizable Asian — either Bruce Lee or Chairman Mao.  </p>
<p><strong>Name one thing you will regret never having done (if you never do it).</strong><br/>
Author and publish a book. At the risk of sounding old school, I want a big, hardcover book, too, not an e-book. I love books and reading.  </p>
<p><strong>If you could meet any historical or fictional person, who would it be?</strong><br/>
Sherlock Holmes (I don’t mean Robert Downey, Jr., although he’d be cool to meet). I’ve read every Sir Arthur Conan Doyle mystery novel on Sherlock Holmes.   </p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite TV show as a kid?</strong><br/>
The cartoon “Starblazers.” And for inexplicable reasons, I enjoyed “Dallas” in grade school.  </p>
<p><strong>What’s the single most important issue in the world today?</strong><br/>
Child obesity. This generation of children may be the first where life expectancy is shorter than their parents.  Most of this is due to diseases related to a lifetime of unhealthy eating habits.  </p>
<p><strong>What would you be doing if you were not in your current job?</strong><br/>
I’d be a Professor of Chinese History. That was my first career ambition.  </p>
<p><strong>What was your first computer?</strong><br/>
My dad bought an IBM PCjr when I was in seventh grade. It cost $1500, I recall, back in 1982.  It came with a big floppy disk that booted WordPerfect. I thought that was amazing. I played my first video game on that PCjr — a text based game called Zyll.  </p>
<p><strong>iPhone, Android or BlackBerry?</strong><br/>
Android. Google gave me a Nexus One by HTC when it first came out. I’ve been running Android ever since.  </p>
<p><strong>What site/app do you check first when you wake up?</strong><br/>
I check Pulse for news while still in bed. Then WeChat to see what my friends are doing. As soon as I get to my PC, I check MyYahoo for all my financial news.  </p>
<p><strong>What was the last thing you fixed?</strong><br/>
A cracked windshield on my wife’s car. I’m too cheap to hire someone so I spent $12 on a DIY kit.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a dog or cat or other pet?</strong><br/>
We have a dog and a hamster. They belong to my daughters Charley and Kaylan.  </p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite mode of transportation?</strong><br/>
The most amazing thing I’ve ever been on is the mag-lev train in Shanghai. It peaked out at 400 km per hour (over 200 mph). Cars on the freeway looked like they were standing still.  </p>
<p><strong>What was the last book you read?</strong><br/>
“The 4-Hour Body” by my friend, Tim Ferriss. I reread it whenever I need to lose 5 lbs. And it worked again!  </p>
<p><strong>Describe an ideal day.</strong><br/>
Kickboxing workout after I wake up. A morning on a warm beach in Cabo with my family. Spend the afternoon with my wife, Lillian, watching our two daughters at their dance competitions. A big Chinese banquet dinner with my parents and relatives. A poker game with friends at night.</p>
