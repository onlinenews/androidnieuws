<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
<h3>Just a little too early to keep it</h3>
<p>                                                             December 18, 2012                </p>

                    I purchased a BLU Dash 3.5 to use on vacation, with a local Mexico sim in slot 2 (quad-band Edge) and an AT&amp;T Gophone sim in slot one. I tested the phone at AT&amp;T and got “H” connection, and it seemed very slow compared to my Tmo Galaxy S II, because it was. The antennae on the Dash 3.5 are about, I believe, half the max speed of 802.11b, or about 4-6Mbps. Better than Edge, certainly, and fine for email. The phone itself, while on wi-fi, was a delight. I loved the launcher, which made it possible to change the size of the fonts and icons on the applications screen. I really liked 2.3.6 (or whatever it has in it), more in fact than ICS on the Galaxy, and of course, far more than 2.1 or 2.2. Skype worked great, and the screen resolution was just fine; not as good as the similarly sized Moto Defy but nice and bright and clear enough. They give you two extra backs, in different colors, which is a cute touch.
<p>SO. My extra batteries arrived, and guess what? They were the model for the plain Dash, not the 3.5. The Dash 3.5 uses the C654804130T, and no one in the entire hemisphere apparently sells them. (Buy.com sells the other one, the one for the plain Dash. It is model C654205110T. An ebay seller with a phone number (who shall remain nameless) gave me that model# and a link to Buy.com. I ordered them before my own Dash 3.5 arrived.)</p>
<p>So unless BLU itself responds with batteries, or Buy.com or its fulfiller finds some, I am sad to say my phone will be returned until such time as BLU gets its act together.</p>
<p>The 1-star loss is because of the slow antenna BLU chose to put on this (and I assume on the VIVO 4.3 also), and the batteries being unavailable.                </p>
<h3>Great phone so far.</h3>
<p>                                                             April 10, 2013                </p>

                    Just got the phone today was pleasantly suprised it worked so well with my ATT sim., still need to test it out with another Sim to test the dual sim properties, booted up and started installing and customizing apps, synched my email without a hitch, phone calls to friend was clear, streaming Pandora on it right now while i type and is coming clear. GPS is accurate using maps and navi. the battery seems to drain a bit faster than i liked. Also for some reason i cant install shazam or any music recognition apps, says its imcompatible to the phone <img src="http://cheapelectronicproduct.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":("/>  Also a friend tried using a spring sim but didnt work, then again sprint uses a different type of cell protocol, CDMA i think, works well with ATT thought here in Cali. One of the biggest suprises of the phone is that you can use teether and use the phone as a wifi hotspot, i wasn’t able to do this on my iphone!
<p>pros +<br/>clear calls,<br/>emails connected smoothly<br/>sim worked right away<br/>streaming with pandora music is smooth<br/>Teethering</p>
<p>con’s -<br/>battery life seems a little less (still need to test this out furthur though)<br/>shazam or any android music recognition isin’t supported for some reason, hoping i can find something out there i can use<br/>cant handle too much multi tasking, when running pandora and webrowsing it seemed to stutter a lil                </p>
<h3>Pretty good Cellphone. But Amazon sent an open-box item / broken seal.</h3>
<p>                                                             January 23, 2013                </p>

<p>                    Have been using for just a week. This cell phone worths the money! Only 175Mb ROM available for App`s. Battery lasts longer than other android phones. Loud speakers, good mic. Camera ok. Easy to choose SIM for calls or SMS. FM radio works pretty well! No bugs yet!!! I`ll be back if that happen!!! CPU is fine. Haven`t use the bluetooth yet.<br/>BUYERS outside the U.S: Be aware on 3g frequency! Some Dash works on 1900. Others on 2100.<br/>***Unexpectedly AMAZON sent me an open-box item, with both seals broken. But the item was sopposed to be brand new!                </p>
<h3>Works with consumer cellular (see notes)</h3>
<p>                                                             March 8, 2013                </p>

                    This Android works great and has a very good performance. I ensured I bought a high-speed storage card (class 10) so that performance wouldn’t be slowed down due to the card. I installed the Consumer Cellular SIM card and the phone worked immediately; however, web and MMS didn’t work. Consumer Cellular support couldn’t see the phone in order to push down the network settings so, I had to do some research. Some info was okay on Internet but not good enough so, after about 3 days, I collected enough info to successfully gain all services to get Web &amp; MMS to work with Consumer Cellular. I hope this helps others. Here are the settings I used (assuming you’ve deleted any APNs you might already have:
<p>Add a new APN and insert in the following values. Notes: If you don’t have all the values available, just enter the ones you do have available (it might still work for you). Some values are purposely left blank and should remain that way. Also note that (on some phones) for “APN type”, no spaces should be used so don’t be tempted to add a space after the comma.</p>
<p>a. Name: Consumer Cellular WEB<br/>b. APN: att.mvno<br/>c. Proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.com<br/>d. Port: 80<br/>e. User Name:<br/>f. Password:<br/>g. Server:<br/>h. MMSC:<br/>i. MMS proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.com<br/>j. MMS port: 80<br/>k. MCC: 310<br/>l. MNC: 410<br/>m. IP Version: IP<br/>n. Authentication type: PAP<br/>o. APN type: default,supl<br/>p. APN Protocol: IPv4</p>
<p>Click . If you don’t see that as an option, you will have to look for what button to push on the phone to reveal it as an option.</p>
<p>Add another new APN and insert the following values.<br/>a. Name: Consumer Cellular MMS<br/>b. APN: att.mvno<br/>c. Proxy: proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.com<br/>d. Port: 80<br/>e. User Name:<br/>f.

Authentication type: PAP<br/>o. APN type: mms<br/>p. APN Protocol: IPv4</p>
<p>Click .                </p>
<h3>Great for the price.</h3>
<p>                                                             April 7, 2013                </p>

                    I’ve had this phone for 2 weeks &amp; its performing well. It fits nice in your hand &amp; it is lightweight. I ordered it from 24hourdeals &amp; I got the charger &amp; data cable, no additional battery covers or screen protectors as other persons have received from other sellers. It does freeze occasionally, but that may be due to the low memory on the phone. You cannot take pictures, receive anything through Bluetooth or save any downloads unless you have a memory card in the phone.
<p>All in all, its a good buy &amp; I guarantee that anyone that purchases this phone will be pleased.                </p>
<h3>Great phone for the economicly minded</h3>
<p>                                                             March 18, 2013                </p>

                    This is a great intro phone or for people who are economy minded. Not the fastest and can’t run tons of apps at the same time, but that’s what I expected. This is obviously not your top tier phone, but it gets the job done. Unlocked, WiFi, Camera, 3G,
<p>Good:<br/>- **less than $90 for an unlocked android!!**<br/>- great phone reception (better than any other phone I’ve probably used)<br/>- nice size/weight, feels great in your hand<br/>- Android 2.3 is pretty good<br/>- Sealed new condition with charger, hands free headphone/mic, battery<br/>- Dropped it a couple times from short heights and it has come through unscathed<br/>- Unlocked/3G/WiFi/Camera/Android all for less than $90, what’s not to like</p>
<p>Neutral:<br/>- Not great WiFi reception (shows low signal, but can still stream netflix fine)<br/>- Onscreen keyboard is a bit small for my fat thumbs, basically fixed using "magic keyboard free" app. I knew it was a smallish (3.5in) screen when I bought it and until this phone I only used qwerty keyboards.</p>
<p>Bad:<br/>- OS is sluggish at times (end up re-tapping and accidentally selecting something I didn’t want as it catches up) due to…<br/>- Running memory is small, you can’t run a lot of service based applications at once (e.g. facebook/mail/battery saver/etc.)<br/>- No camera flash means you can’t get any decent pictures in low light area</p>
<p>If you don’t care about having 4G, 2 cameras, no flash for the camera, then this is a great bargain.                </p>
<h3>Download online manual</h3>
<p>                                                             June 18, 2013                </p>

<p>                    I haven’t even received my phone yet, but I decided to read through the comments again and I noticed a lot of people complaining about many things such as no online support, not knowing what all the symbols mean or how to do this or that. Much of the stuff I read was wrong according to the manual (we will see when my phone gets here) Download the manual here and get all your questions answered. bluproducts.com/pro-detail/dash35                </p>
