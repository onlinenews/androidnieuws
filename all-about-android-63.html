      <h1>All About Android 63</h1>
      <p><p>I love listening to your show! I've had my HTC Evo 4G (my first Android phone) for about 6 months and I love it! The one exception to my love being that my phone's internal storage keeps filling up way too fast. I have a 32 gb memory card where I store my photos and music and as many applications as I can. However the vast majority of apps that I use regularly can not be moved to the SD card. I've deleted all of the phone storage only apps that I never use (besides the dreaded bloatware that can not be deleted) and moved all that I can to the SD, but my phone still is saying, about twice a week, that my storage is full. Then I am forced to uninstall updates and/or sacrifice another app I like if I want to continue to receive my emails on my phone. What else can I do? Please help!
</p><p>I was just listening to your show Episode 62 and thought you needed to
know that the voice recognition is mainly for us blue tooth users.
If you have a headset, (I know you are dead set against) all you
have to do is hit the button on your headset and state a command. I never
have to touch the phone mounted on my dash (Love Velcro lol)
</p><p>I know you all hate accessories but with an A2DP headset and the Sony
watch, you don't need to pull out your phone almost ever. For uber geeks
this is the best
