      <h1>All About Android 72</h1>
      <p><p>I've only just caught up watching episode 71 tonight, a week behind, so this may be a little late but hopefully still of interest for you Jason. In the Arena in episode 71 you reviewed the six axis controller app. I too have my six axis controller hooked up to my Samsung Galaxy SII. I use it to play all sorts of games including Real Football 2012, AirAttack HD, Reckless Racing, Pew Pew even Temple Run. The touch emulation mode is very powerful.
</p><p>Although this app works perfectly I find it difficult to play using the controller since holding the controller leaves no free hands to hold the phone so I'm always balancing it in my lap. Obviously this is a common problem since I have come across this accessory.
</p><p>I hope you find this helpful.
</p><p>Cheers and Kia Ora from New Zealand.
</p><p>I am a listener of you show since episode one, and I love it.
</p><p>I am an Android user since about 1.5 years now, and I love my Android experience. But there was always a missing feature that I wanted: get notifications when some applications gets updated, for these reasons:
</p>
<p>I looked around but found no app/service that can send me notification when an app gets updated, so, being a software developer, I developed this service, and provided it to everybody on the web, and I called it: AppFeed
</p><p>Thanks in advance, hope that you like my work, and that you mention it on your show.
