(Drawings by Alexia Cahyaningtyas).</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, teenagers used to fall asleep next to a book, whether it’s a diary or a novel. Things are different these days as teenagers choose to sleep next to their gadgets.</p>
<p>Reading has increasingly been neglected since more and more children see it as an unimportant activity. Everything seems to happen or work instantly in recent years that finishing a whole novel — that requires time and patience — is no longer appealing for children. They’d rather watch a movie based on a book rather than reading the book itself; even when most of the time, the book is better than the movie. Reading is seen as a chore to those who are not brought up enjoying it.</p>
<p>I am a gadget fan too, an Android fan to be precise. However, I do agree that gadgets decrease your social skills, even though you are on social media. You interact differently through Facebook compared to your real life situations.</p>
<p>Also, I have to admit to that I do fall asleep next to a gadget most of the time, but I am trying my best to change that.<br/>
In this technological era, everyone’s brainwashed to own a gadget, even little children have their own set of gadgets. When I was their age, I wasn’t even allowed to own a mobile phone until the age of 14. That is why the younger generation in recent years doesn’t grow up enjoying books, but playing games and chatting on tablet computers instead.</p>
<p>To be fair, it’s not entirely their fault. Maybe the environment they are in doesn’t encourage them to read.<br/>
I was lucky to grow up in a family where everyone loves to read. My mother is an avid novel reader. She loves reading crime novels, she said it’s a way to escape reality and immerse yourself into a different world as you start to imagine what the characters and the setting look like.</p>
<p>My father and I like the same thing: books that are based on history or facts. We borrow each other’s books every now and then because we have the same taste. My brother reads anything supernatural and “out of this world”, science fiction, and Guinness Book Records series.</p>
<p>Another problem is that good libraries are almost nowhere to be found in Jakarta. The closest thing to a good library in town is the Gramedia bookstore, which my father calls the public library. We often visit the store just to browse books and read them on the spot.</p>
<p>I think that every municipality in Jakarta should have a library. It doesn’t have to be fancy as long as it’s equipped with enough facilities and books that are needed to promote reading back to the society. It won’t cost too much to start a community library. Maybe the neighborhood leader (ketua RT) has an empty room or garage where shelves can be installed. Just make a cozy setting and everyone can donate books.</p>
<p>Promoting reading can also be done in schools. I am impressed by schools that encourage reading. Some schools try to make reading an important thing to do by telling everyone to read, including the cleaning staff and the security guards.</p>
<p>Apart from the big things, we can start from ourselves. Let’s put the gadgets down (and I am also saying this to myself!), and pick up a book instead before sleeping. After all, reading is a much healthier way to end your day while staring at a laptop or a gadget before you sleep doesn’t help you to sleep. Enjoy!</p>
