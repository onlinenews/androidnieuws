      <h1>Contactive – A Call Management App for Android Devices That Works</h1>
      <p>&#13;
				<p align="center">Lots of us have tried to keep our communication lines private, but some of us still receive calls from anonymous callers. How many times do you receive calls from anonymous callers? Whether you receive calls once a month, once a week, or once a day, the identity of your caller is an important matter of security.</p>
<p>Then Caller ID steps in. At a time when smartphones are taking over and dominating our means of communications, Caller ID apps provide the security and privacy we need to avoid bogus callers and fake identities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Pitch</b></p>
<p><a title="Contactive" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contactive&amp;referrer=utm_source=gdgts.ph&amp;utm_medium=feature" target="_blank">Contactive</a> is a call management application for Android smartphones to combine and power up the functionalities of the contacts list and caller IDs. The app automates the search of names associated with public phone numbers, as it scans public directories and address books and rummages through updated public social network profiles. As a result, Contactive promptly shows all the significant data about a particular caller before the user answers the call. The app allows users to see the name, photo, email address, current city, latest tweet and Facebook status update, and jobs associated with the phone number of an anonymous caller.</p>
<p>Contactive collects publicly available personal information from an expanding list of sources that include social networking sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and directories, such as Yelp, Gmail, Google Places, White and Yellow Pages, and Contactive’s own Global Directory.</p>
<p>Contactive says the app is “the natural evolution of Caller ID,” and it aims to make the calling experience friendlier to users.</p>

<p><b>In A Nutshell</b></p>
<p>With so many Caller ID apps on the Google Play Store, it is wise to test each one, especially those Android apps with above average and higher ratings, before a final decision is made. Contactive has a <a title="Contactive" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contactive&amp;referrer=utm_source=gdgts.ph&amp;utm_medium=feature" target="_blank">3.5 rating on the Play Store</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded and installed Contactive, log in to your social networks, to start testing a number of its features. Here are the steps on how to do that:</p>
<p>1. Dial and call a random number or the number of someone you know but is not listed in your address book and see how Contactive pulls up information associated with the number as you the call connects. The same process happens when you receive a call. Popular restaurants and business establishments usually work best for the tests.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialbarrel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contactive-1.png"><img alt="contactive" src="http://socialbarrel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contactive-1.png" width="288" height="512"/></a>2. Ask a friend in a social network, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, to call you. Once that friend, unlisted in your phone’s contacts list, calls you, a profile of the caller will appear when your phone rings. The profile shows the latest profile photo, Facebook status updates, tweets, job info, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialbarrel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contactive-2.png"><img alt="contactive" src="http://socialbarrel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contactive-2.png" width="288" height="512"/></a></p>
<p>3. Look into the contacts lists that Contactive automatically sorts out on your Android phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialbarrel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contactive-3.png"><img alt="contactive" src="http://socialbarrel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contactive-3.png" width="288" height="512"/></a>4. Search for any type of profile information and the app will show you a real-time list of results.</p>
<p>5. Contactive allows you to call favorites.</p>
<p/>
<p><b>Features</b></p>
<p>1. Universal Caller ID</p>
<p>When you look for a phone number over the Internet, you usually end up with the name associated with the number. The name allows almost anyone to pull publicly available information from web services, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yelp, or Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Contactive uses this method to search automatically for a caller’s identification within a few seconds and returns the publicly available information it finds on the Internet and in its own Global Directory.</p>
<p>2. Publicly Available Numbers Only</p>
<p>Contactive respects and cannot pull private and blocked numbers, even though it shows Caller IDs from hundreds of millions of callers. In addition, not all publicly available phone numbers on the Internet have associated information.</p>
<p>3. Security</p>
<p>As an added security, people who only know your name, and not your phone number, cannot search for your number through Contactive. However, people who know your number can see the publicly available name associated with that number.</p>
<p>Contactive says it does not sell the phone numbers and names of its subscribers. It will not communicate with your contacts without your permission and abiding with its terms of service. In short, Contactive only keeps phone numbers and links of information publicly available on the Internet.</p>
<p>4. Privacy</p>
<p>The Caller ID application only stores a few types of associated information: phone numbers, names, and publicly available information from supported online accounts. Contactive says it will not share private information about its subscribers and their contacts without explicit consent. All shown information are aggregated from online content available to the public.</p>
<p>Contactive uses Google Search, Wikipedia, Yelp, and its own websites to deliver quick information to its users. The company servers store the information pulled from the Internet for only 24 hours. As a result, data from social media services, such as Facebook and Twitter, are not stored and will always display real-time status updates and tweets.</p>
<p>If you do not want Contactive to store your information, send a request to its customer support email address. If you wish to have your information removed from Contactive, simply send a request to its <a href="mailto:support@contactive.com" target="_blank">customer support email address</a> for quick removal.</p>
<p>5. Unified Address Book</p>
<p>Contactive will not automatically modify the default Android Contacts app. If you add a contact within Contactive, the app will redirect you to the default contacts app to make changes manually.</p>
<p>Contactive makes its separate custom version of the default address book to merge contacts safely. You may access the custom address book again if you lost your phone with a simple install of Contactive and signing in your credentials. If you simply want the information to be deleted, especially for stolen phones, email its <a href="mailto:support@contactive.com">customer support email address</a>.</p>
<p>6. Customer Support</p>
<p>If the app automatically combines your contact information from several online accounts, complicated situations may arise and need cutting-edge procedures to determine the right person. In some instances, the situation will go out of hand.</p>
<p>For instance, a number of people have exactly the same first names and family names while some people use aliases or nicknames in address books. These pseudonyms may be different from the names they entered in social media accounts.</p>
<p>Contactive is limited to all the publicly available information to raise the best decisions to match contact information. As a result, errors will happen.</p>
<p>7. Supported Devices</p>
<p>Contactive is only available to Android smartphones and tablets installed with the Android 2.3 Gingerbread operating system or higher. The company said it is working on expanding support to other platforms.</p>
<p>8. Contacts Lists</p>
<p>Contactive automatically creates contacts lists or groups based on the social networks associated with the app. The lists simplify call management and email distribution.</p>
<p>9. Call Management</p>
<p>Once you enable the app’s “Call Management” setting, you allow Contactive to modify the built-in Android phone call screen. Consequently, it is wise not to install other call management or caller ID apps on the same Android devices as Contactive.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>The Critique</b></p>
<p>While it helps pinpoint hundreds of millions of anonymous callers prior to answering calls, Contactive’s Universal Caller ID and management system is still limited to publicly available information on the Internet and on social networking sites. However, this is not to say the app is nonfunctional. It basically operates the same way as other popular call management applications on the Google Play Store. Its main selling point its growing list of sources that include the Contactive Global Directory, Facebook, Gmail, Google Places, LinkedIn, Skype, Tango, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Yelp.</p>
<p>SocialBarrel suggests that you give the Contactive app a try through <a title="Contactive" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contactive&amp;referrer=utm_source=gdgts.ph&amp;utm_medium=feature" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
