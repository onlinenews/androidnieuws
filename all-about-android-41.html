      <h1>All About Android 41</h1>
      <p><p>I was wondering if there are any android modes or apps that allow you to set custom alert tones for specific contacts sort of like you can do in iOS 5.
</p><p>So far I find that I can use apps like Ringo to set the tones but it requires me to my phones default tones to silent or else it will play the default tone and the alert tone I picked. I have not found a solution that lets you set tones for specific people and plays the default for everyone else.
</p><p>I am have been on a Verizon BB curve for 2.5 years now and I want to get an android. I was thinking of getting a RAZR or Galaxy nexus but after reading and hearing some reviews I am thinking maybe I should wait to see if something better might be on the near horizon. What is your opinion? Have u heard of any thing that might be worth waiting for? Do u know of any details regarding a possible Galaxy S3 or RAZR Maxx or some other cool phones for Verizon? Or should I just get the Nexus? But I have heard that the nexus has a bad speaker and it can be difficult to hear driving direction in a car.
