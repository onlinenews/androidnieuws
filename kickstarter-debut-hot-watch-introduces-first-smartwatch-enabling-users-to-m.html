Kickstarter Debut:  HOT Watch Introduces First Smartwatch Enabling Users to Make Calls Directly from the User's Watch-Hand
		HOT Watch, an acronym for Hands On Talk, is the Complete Smartwatch Solution Boasting a Multitude of Features &amp; Functionality 
		
		
		
(July 15, 2013)









DMN Newswire--2013-7-15--<p>(Plano, TX - July 15, 2013) PH Technical Labs unveiled its ground breaking new Smartwatch that, for the first time, allows users to make and receive private phone calls directly from the watch - in which the user simply holds the watch-hand-palm up to his/her ear, speaks into the built-in microphone and listens via simplistic, yet innovative "palm and sound waves" technology (i.e. the receiving voice is amplified by the user's palm.) The Smartwatch, entitled HOT Watch (an acronym for "Hands On Talk") will debut on the popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter today. <p/></p>  <p>       HOT Watch works with all Smartphones that are Bluetooth compatible, (Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and normal Bluetooth mode for power saving) but complete features are currently available with Android and iPhone Smartphones. "We set out to create the best Smartwatch on the market, while also setting your hands free from your mobile phone for most daily functions," states PH Technical Labs President Shariq Hamid. Chief Technology Officer Ram Pattikonda adds, "Other Smart Watches fail in one major area - they cannot do private calls. But we've changed that with the HOT Watch. It's just as easy as raising your hand to your ear. Our vision goes back to well beyond filing for the initial patent in 2010 and we feel we have produced the most COMPLETE Smartwatch solution in which, together,  we can change the way people communicate."  Along with direct, private audible communication, HOT Watch employs the multitude of functions and applications most Smartphones possess via its next generation multi-touch screen and  4 customizable shortcuts for ease of use:   Send and receive texts, social media interface with Facebook and Twitter alerts, instant messaging, send/receive email (with a choice of vibration or audible notifications) as well as accessing contacts from the user's phone,  weather, stocks, calendar, caller ID, stopwatch, calculator, music control, news, pedometer, custom applications and many more.  Thanks to HOT Watch's accelerometer with gyroscope, it is also "gesture" controlled via HOT Gestures that allow the user to answer a call by simply raising the watch-hand up to his/her ear or by making the "wave bye-bye motion" to end a call (or users can bypass this function by simply using the multi-touch screen.)<p/></p>  <p>       Beyond traditional phone functions HOT Watch possesses many other convenience, safety and fitness features including:  Simply using HOT Watch diminishes opportunities for users to drop or damage their expensive phones.  An alert notifying users when they are out of range from the associated phone (generally a 20 feet radius) helps prevent losing or leaving the phone behind and it can also help track down a misplaced phone.   Driving and communication are just a voice away - no more texting as the wristband speaker-phone allows users to keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road with superb voice clarity.  Another function detects if the user has fallen and is in need of emergency care which, after a given span of time, will text a designated emergency contact.  Not to mention diminished health risks with less frequent direct mobile phone contact.  Monitoring calories burned and distance walked/ran is just a touch away with HOT Watch's built-in Calorie/Pedometer application. And finally, let's not forget about style! HOT watch's fashion forward look was designed by Michael Foley, a celebrated designer behind many popular watch faces. It comes in two models: HOT Watch and HOT Watch Titanium, with each being 8mm thin, water resistant and with 4 available watch faces (analog and digital.)<p/></p><br clear="all"/><a href="http://ads.digitalmedianet.com/ads/servlet/click/zone?zid=1271&amp;pid=0&amp;lookup=true&amp;position=1" target="_blank"><img src="http://ads.digitalmedianet.com/ads/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1271&amp;pid=0&amp;position=1" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click" here=""/></a>   <p>       HOT Watch is a huge step forward towards a more effortless communication experience and the Kickstarter campaign, which begins today, will help fund the final prototype and move forward with mass production and distribution.  For more information, funding increments and to support and see a full HOT Watch demonstration logon to:  Kickstarter.com  - keyword HOT Watch<p/></p>  <p>Website:  www.HotSmartWatch.com <p/></p>  <p>Facebook: www.facebook.com/HOTSmartWatch <p/></p>  <p>Twitter: www.twitter.com/HotSmartWatch</p>  <p>About PH Technical Labs:<p/></p>  <p>PH Technical Labs - (PHTL), a Dallas, TX based company, provides innovative solutions for common problems faced by all industries.
