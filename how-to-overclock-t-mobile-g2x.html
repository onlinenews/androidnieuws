How to Overclock T-Mobile G2X
<p>
</p><img width="400" height="250" src="http://www.android.gs/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Overclock-T-Mobile-LG-G2X-460x460-400x250.jpg" alt=""/><p>When having a mid-range Android based smartphone, it’s all about upgrading procedures. It’s really hard not to try to power up the performances of your handset since there are many methods that can be easily used, not to mention that almost all the devices available on the market can be customized and optimized by using custom and unofficial operations. So, if you own the T-Mobile LG G2X phone, which has been released in 2011 and has low range to mid-range specs and features, you must learn how to bump the speeds, update the OS and improve the performances, or mixing all by overclocking its CPU.</p>
<p>That’s what we will be checking during the present step by step guide: how to easily overclock the T-Mobile G2X. By <a href="http://www.android.gs/overclocking-android-everything-about/" target="_blank">overclocking your Android device</a> (check the link if you want to learn more aspects about this procedure – then return here and resume the guidelines from below) you will be able to gain more speed and improve the performances. In a few words, overclocking means that you will change the maximum frequency supported by the CPU, something that’s similar with overclocking your personal computer. Well, if you want to do the same for your LG G2X, follow and complete this tutorial.</p>
<p>You should be careful when trying to bump the speeds as if you increase too much the frequency, the CPU might get burned, or you might end up in bricking your T-Mobile G2X. Also, there might be battery drain issues, so for avoiding these facts, increase the frequency with only 10-20%. You can learn more about how to properly overclock your Android device by checking the link from above.</p><p>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, overclocking your T-Mobile LG G2X will imply in voiding the warranty; after all this is an unofficial operation that has nothing to do with Google or LG. The warranty will get void because you will have to <a href="http://www.android.gs/root-any-android-based-device/" target="_blank">root your smartphone</a> before applying the lines from below. In this way you can prepare your device for the overclocking procedure. Also, after gaining root access, install a custom recovery image, such as CWM recovery, on your handset. The stock recovery can’t be used on this tutorial.</p>
<p>Now, as you will see below, before improving the processor’s performances, you will have to flash a custom kernel on your LG G2X. By doing this you will enable overclocking capability on your device so don’t skip the installation procedure. Take note though, as if your phone is running on a custom ROM firmware, a custom kernel might be already featured, which means that you can overclock your Android device right away.</p>
<p>Also, related to the lost warranty, you can regain the same by downgrading your T-Mobile G2X to stock Android OS, or by updating to an official firmware. Of course, then the root access will be revoked and the factory restrictions reinstalled.</p>
<p>Another thing that must be noticed is related to your personal info and data. By completing the steps from below, you might lose the G2X data, so it is more than recommended to make a backup (a full backup, so remember to <a href="http://www.android.gs/backup-and-restore-your-android-device-using-clockworkmod-recovery-2/" target="_blank">save the current ROM</a> while storing your text messages, call logs, market apps, calendar info and so on) before going any further.</p>
<p>That’s all; now you can safely apply the steps from below. You will have to use a computer, your phone and its USB cable. On the computer you should deactivate the security tools first, as the antivirus, antimalware and Firewall protection is usually interfering with your work. On your phone the USB debugging option must be checked and the battery must be charged – if the battery level is below 60% don’t go any further without charging the battery; else your device might get turned off and bricked while you are trying to overclock its CPU. And complete this tutorial only if you own the T-Mobile LG G2X Android based smartphone.</p>
<h2>How to flash a custom kernel on T-Mobile G2X</h2>
From <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1102720" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">this</a> page download the custom kernel (don’t forget to thanks the xda-developers team for the same).
Save the package on your computer and don’t unzip the file.
Connect your device with the computer via USB cable.
Select the kernel and copy-paste it from the computer to your phone’s SD card.
Disconnect the devices and turn off your handset.
Reboot the G2X in recovery mode.
Then, select “wipe data factory reset”, “wipe cache partition” and “wipe dalvick cache”.
Select “+++go back+++” and from the recovery menu choose “install zip from SD card” and “choose zip from SD card”.
Pick the custom kernel file and flash the same.
Return to recovery and select “reboot system now”.
<h2>How to overclock T-Mobile LG G2X</h2>
Take your phone and access Google Play.
From there download the Faux123 Kernel Enhancement Pro app, or the SetCPU tool.
Install the app on your smartphone and then run the same.
Follow the on-screen prompts for adjusting the frequency.
When done, close the app and test the new performances.
That’s it, your work is over.
<p>Congratulations, now your T-Mobile LG G2X is running faster than ever and you can enjoy HD movies, 3D games, multitasking capabilities and so on.
