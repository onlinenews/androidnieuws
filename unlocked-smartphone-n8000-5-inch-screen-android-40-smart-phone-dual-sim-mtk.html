<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
<h3>An extremely nice surprise.</h3>
<p>                                                             September 12, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I was looking for an unlocked Android 4.0 phone. After doing some research, reading some reviews I narrowed it down to this phone. On paper it seems to have all the features I wanted: Android 4.0.4, large screen, unlocked, dual SIM and an affordable price. I must say, I see people who order things from China and I was a bit skeptical. So, I took a leap of faith and I ordered this phone. It took about 5-6 days to get the order confirmation. Once the order was processed it took a few more days to get the package out and delivery took around 7 days. Not bad if when the estimated delivery date was somewhere in or after October 10th. I got my phone after Labor Day holiday (Sept 4). So, very pleased with the delivery and the packaging was good too. It came in an envelope but inside the envelope the original from factory box was wrapped on layers and layers of bubble wraps. It’s worth to mention the factory box was also very sturdy and capable to resist bumps and heavier objects, in short, not your typical cardboard box many electronic ship these days. That was a plus considering the long trip from China. About the phone, the phone came with two batteries, wired earphone and microphone, charger with USB cable, plastic clip-on shell(it gets keep a better grip as the phone fairly thin). The cable for the charger also works as USB cable for the PC. The phone came loaded with Android 4.0.4 dated to August 2012 (no bad!). The screen is huge, it feels you are holding a mini-mini tablet. It feel sturdy and well built. This was one of my concerns when i ordered, but once I opened the box I was very satisfied with the built quality and materials. I like the big screen, it’s crisp , bright, very responsive, no dead pixels or lag. Multi-touch works great. I installed my T-mobile SIM and it worked without any additional action. I also used Wifi to make internet calls and it works good. I installed Viber and Imo and they both work good for internet calls. Viber seems to have better sound, but more attenuation, Imo seems to have better connectivity but the sound is way lower (maybe smaller data packets?). Of course, I installed Angry Birds, the big screen makes it great to play. The phone has two cameras, both worked flawlessly. I was able to switch cameras and take pics without any problem. The quality is acceptable considering the price, I mean, i hear people bitch about bad quality pics from phone’s cameras and they seem to forget, its a phone not a camera. Ok, back to the review. The phone comes with GPS, I haven’t tried it. It comes with TV and even small antenna. So far it seems to have capability for analog, in USA that’s pretty much useless as all TV signals are digital. Not sure if there is an app or if the phone will allow digital signal. Anyway, i didn’t buy the phone for that reason. It would be a nice to have but not a must have. Calls are nice and clear. No dropping no problems. I only noticed it gets a bit warm after 15-20mins of use during a call. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would certainly recommend. One last thing, just for reference, the phone seems to have great similarity with Samsung Galaxy Note.                </p>
<h3>Worth every penny!</h3>
<p>                                                             October 9, 2012                </p>

                    The seller was great as well as the phone. Had mine working in 5 minutes after I charged the battery.<br/>The first thing you need to do is set ENGLISH as the language if thats what you speak. Otherwise everything is in Chinese. There are sever web sites on there from China and you can delete them. Google shows up in the China version but all you need to do is change the ending fron .CN to .COM same for Yahoo.<br/>Phone quality is clear and crisp. Camera works better than most others I have seen. I would recommend that you install a mini SD card and put your downloads on it rather than taking up phone memory.<br/>Phone is thin compared to an I phone. Battery is easy to get at and you will get 2 batteries , a cover and an installed screen protectoe if you get the expidited shipping. It is only $14 plus you will get the phone in about a week.<br/>All the features work very well but the TV is useless in the USA. Manual comes with it but it could be a little better but you can say that for most every phone.<br/>I would get another one like this if I needed it and would recommend it to anyone that wants a bigger screen and doesn’t want to get sucked into another 2 year contract. Once you put in the SIM card you are good to go.
<p>I was asked which supplier I purchased my phone from, it was the Super Saving Store. I hope that answers your question.</p>
<p>I have had this phone for several months and still think it is great. I did want to add some additional information. The phone is a knockoff of a Samsung, has almost all the same features and looks like a Samsung Galaxy BUT , Samsung Galaxy batteries will not fit this phone. I keep my phones for a long time. I did get a second battery with the phone but figured I should get a couple more just in case one went bad. I found that the batteries for an N8000 , which this is, are available from DHgate.com for about $12.00 for 2 including shipping. Takes about 4 weeks to get them but now I feel better with extra batteries in hand.                </p>
<h3>Beautiful phone</h3>
<p>                                                             September 17, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I wanted to get my wife a phone, and naturally she wanted an IPhone. Currently, she uses T-Mobile pre-paid. So I asked what it was she really wanted – turned out there were two characteristics: easy to text, and white! Well, I took a chance on this phone. We got it in a week (from Hong Kong), and she loves it. Very big screen, but not too big, looks great. Solid construction, very responsive. And white! I just dropped in the T-Mobile SIM card, and she was busily texting in a few minutes.                </p>
<h3>Love it!!</h3>
<p>                                                             September 20, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I love this phone, I bought it for myself, and my fiancé loved it now we buying a second one. Although its from China, but aren’t all phone made from China? Works as good but I really wish they made a lot of cases for this phone it’s really hard to find a case.                </p>
<h3>Not what I was expecting!</h3>
<p>                                                             October 24, 2012                </p>

                    I felt like I had to review this phone because although this phone is great it has a few minor flaws but what handheld system doesn’t?
<p>Shipping and ordering:<br/>I received my phone in about 6 business days with expedited shipping which I think was great considering my phone came out of Hong Kong. I admit I was really skeptical of buying out of my country but I took a chance on this phone and it came perfect. The packaging was great and looked like it could survive a couple of rough bumps which was great considering the long trip it had to the states. If you are thinking of buying this phone do not buy from anyone but amazon. They will keep your information safe and monitor the entire trip. However it would have been nice to have tracking information available but I did not worry about it.</p>
<p>Receiving the phone and T-Mobile coverage:<br/>In the box I received a phone, 2 batteries, a wall charger, 3 screen protectors (one already installed), a usb cable and a set of headphones. Everything was in excellent condition and worked great! Immediately when I got the phone I installed my t-mobile sim card and inserted a 8gb micro sd card which I recommend because the internal memory tends to get crowded pretty quickly. It took me about 10 minutes to get my plan and service going and about 6 hours for the internet to start working.</p>
<p>I thought it was great how t-mobile noticed that i could not use the internet so they sent me instructions on how to set it up. It took me about 5 minutes and after I had full functioning service. I noticed without the wi-fi on, the phone internet is kinda laggy but still faster than most phones I had in the past. Be sure that whatever service you plan on using that it works in your area.</p>
<p>About the phone:<br/>This phone is easy to maneuver and very responsive. I like how it was not overstocked with pre-installed apps that I would find no use for. The only one that I find unnecessary is the television feature. Although it would have been nice to have, we do not have any use for it in the states. It does have an antenna but its located inside the phone and actually looks like a stylus pin from afar.</p>
<p>The battery life on this phone is great. It does take a while to fully charge, but even on 50% I tend to get about 6 hours of battery life before it dies on me. I think its great that 2 batteries are included so your phone should last a while on one charge.</p>
<p>The phone comes with the goggle play store already installed and was amazed at how many apps come included. I got apps that even my old virgin mobile phone could not get! A lot of the apps are free and I suggest you put them on your sd card so can enjoy all of your apps without having to delete them off the phone to make room.</p>
<p>The phone runs on android 4.0.4 which allow for a great browsing experience when you are playing with this phone. I get 3g service in most places in my area which I think was great considering I paid under $200 for this phone that looks like it could be worth $500.</p>
<p>The camera on this phone is decent for the price. Even in dim light I can take great pictures with the back camera, however the front camera is grainy sometimes even when there is light in the room. I think it is great also that this phone takes screen shots (just hold down the top power button and the down key on the volume button)</p>
<p>Accessories and the cons:<br/>When I first got this phone I immediately looked for a case for it and got nothing. Instead I took a chance on a galaxy note case that was made of tough rubber and it fits great. Not like a glove but I know my phone is not going anywhere. Although the buttons are off, there is enough room in the case where I can just simply press and it will work fine. But if you wanted to use your headphones you would have to take the case off.</p>
<p>There is only one con about this phone I noticed in the few days I had it is that when I am charging the phone and I try to use it, the buttons tend to have a mind of its and decides to do what it wants. When I take the phone off the charger it works fine again so I try not to mess with it while its charging. This is the only reason the phone does not get 5 stars but it is still a great phone either way.</p>
<p>Overall I really like this phone. I feel that I made a great purchase and had a great seller also (thankyou abettershop!) I would recommend this for anyone who is a beginner android user or if you just want a cheap android phone with great features.                </p>
<h3>WOW Amazing!!!!!</h3>
<p>                                                             November 1, 2012                </p>

<p>                    Everyone else who did a review before me hit the nail on the head. This Phone is in one word AMAZING!!!!! I love everything about this phone. It came from Hong Kong to NC in 10 days well secured in the the original box, then wrapped in bubble wrap and then in a box and then taped up. The phone is responsive, crisp and beautiful. I love this phone. I highly recommend it!!!                </p>
<h3>N8000 Good Buy!</h3>
<p>                                                             September 22, 2012                </p>

<p>                    N8000 Clone Note 5 inch came in and looked like someone had ordered it and returned had phone numbers in it<br/>the volume button was a little loose and the camera flash was loose being that I needed a cell phone asap<br/>I tightened the flash lens with hot glue problem solved. The phone that came was not the same pictured no TV really who cares about that and the camera was on the left top corner not as the description pic in the middle OK still no big deal. Outside the camera takes good pics for what it is inside up close good far away not so good, flash works good and there is an app in the phone for a flash light pretty cool. Screen fine works nice for the price and it is fast I would suggest putting in an app to increase volume that helped a lot. Speaker phone is ok<br/>not the greatest but, neither is my husbands $600.00 phone. Now lets get to the dual sims love love I have<br/>STRAIGHT TALK GMS ordered a sim and put it in put in APN settings it sounds hard but, it’s not and I had service in 10 minutes so, all the ones that watched you tube trying to find out if it works on ST it does as long as it says in the phone description GMS 850m/1800m/1900m 3G UNLOCKED and because it is dual sim you can have two numbers just go to a pre pay WCDMA provider and there you go two line switch back and forth.<br/>Remember this does not have all the bells and whistles the $600.00 phone has it still is a nice cell it comes with two batteries which is nice ( Ok battery life when not using wifi, bluetooth turn off and install an app killer and adjust screen brightness will help) and the wifi connected fine the phone found it put in my password and I was off and surfing. For the price it is a good buy!                </p>
<h3>very good</h3>

<p>                    I ordered the Star N8000 from lolbuy on Nov.15 and recieved it in the mail on Nov.23. The phone says its 5″ but its really 5.3″. There is no case for this phone so i ordered 2 GALAXY NOTE N7000/19220 cases from amazon one hard case and one silicone case to see how they would fit. For the hard case just type in (White and Hot Pink Dual layer hybrid cover case and kickstand for samsung galaxy note N7000/19220 $3.62). For soft case I ordered(Pink cassette tape silicone case for galaxy note n7000/19220 $3.80). The hybrid case fits my phone pretty good but the case covers up the power on button and volume key which is fine cause I just press the middle button to turn my phone on and i never really use the volume button. I can charge my phone up fine and take pics using back camera with case on so thats all that matters to me. The silicone case fits good too you can easily press volume and power on button. I am with tmobile prepaid $30 100min unlimited text and web plan I downloaded skype and pay $3/month for unlimted talk thats my way of getting around the 100min tmbobile gives so I only pay $33/month and pretty much have unlimited everythang. Put sim card in and it works pretty good. I like this phone because it is compatible with tmobile,att,straight talk,and simple mobile. So if you get tired of one company you can just buy a sim card for a different company and pop sim in phone after activating. what I like most about this phone is that it has video wallpaper, so you can set any video on your sd card as your wallpaper. You can use this phone as hotspot. Volume is very loud when playing movies. You can easily sinc movies/music from computer to phone using usb cord, some phones wont do that. The camera and camcorder isnt that good but it’ll do if you’re around alot of light. All apps I downloaded so far seem to work like facebook, youtube,angry birds, temple run etc… The phone works pretty fast when on the web without wifi although youtube runs very slow but thats because I only get 2g speed with my tmobile plan but works very fast with wifi. Also if you want phone in white after you order the phone just go to contact this seller under myaccount and tel them you want phone in white in the email and they will send you a white one thats what I did. I would definately recommend this phone for the size and price you cant beat that. I love my phone thanks DANIEL CHEN                </p>
