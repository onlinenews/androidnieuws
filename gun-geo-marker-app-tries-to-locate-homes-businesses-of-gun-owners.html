<p>A new Android app asks users to expose the home addresses of gun owners they deem potentially unsafe -- and share that information with the world. </p><p>The Gun Geo Marker app, released to Googles Play app store on July 7, invites users to mark the homes and businesses of suspected unsafe gun owners  to help others in the area learn about their geography of risk from gun accidents or violence."<br clear="all"/></p>

<p>No reason you can’t use the firearms app to identify suspected homosexuals as unsafe gun owners.</p>
<p>Or local politicians, people who let their dog use your front yard, suspected TEA Party leaders, SIEU members.</p>
<p>Or just go through your local phone directory from Aanthony A. Aardvarrk to Zelda Z. Zzzimmermann.</p>

    <p>“Ok, lets counter-attack.</p>

<p>Just use the same app flagging them as owners of unsecured Class 3 weapons. Less effort than a new app.</p>
<p>There was an effort among some churches to have a database of houses where it was safe to let your kids play. Gun owners were never on the “safe” list and if someone found out that a house had guns it was dropped from the “safe” list. Same idea here.</p>

    <p>Buy the app so you can add every address. Trash their database with so many false positives that their results are meaningless. Don’t forget to list an armed pedophile at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (note: I’m not claiming the drug-addled communist is an actual pedophile, I don’t know whether the skeet shooter prefers boys just over 18 or under age, just that it would be fun to contaminate this database with unsubstantiated accusations).</p>
