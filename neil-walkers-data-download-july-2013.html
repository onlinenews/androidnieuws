Well its about time to update the Google Analytics statistics with a focus on Mobile and Tablet usage for 2013</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Tools you might Need</h2>
<p>If your good with Google Docs or handling APIs then you can cut out the tools and go and have a look at:</p>
<p>There are other options.</p>
<p><img alt="Zag when everyone Zig's" src="http://www.stateofsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Neil-walkers-data-download-July-2013-300x217.jpg" width="300" height="217"/></p>
<p>There are a number of tools that are custom built for handling large data, in particular when it comes to Google Analytics; two of my choices are:</p>
<p>So what’s the point; well in this scenario I’ve used Next Analytics and quickly taken 16 independent Google Analytics Profiles and within minutes exported over 120,000 rows of data (This is a small data set, for bigger data-sets I would personally recommend Analytics Canvas.)</p>
<h2>Now its time for Some Big Data Fun.</h2>
<p><img alt="Big Data Fun" src="http://www.stateofsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Neil-walkers-big-data-fun-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199"/></p>
<h3>A Simple Answer to Enhanced Campaigns</h3>
<p>Towards the end of this month Google is automatically upgrading all Adwords Accounts to <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/adwords/enhancedcampaigns/" target="_blank">Enhanced Campaigns</a>. One of the main parts of enhanced campaign is that advertisers no longer have the choice of whether or not display ads to mobile device and tablets. Much as this has annoyed many an advertiser and the general consensus is that is has driven CPC’s up – <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/digital-marketing/search-engine-marketing/google-enhanced-campaigns-to-impact-googles-ad-revenue-new-algorithms-crucial-for-advertiser-success/" target="_blank">See Adobe’s full report from June 2013</a>.</p>
<p>So how is Mobile and Tablet Traffic increasing? A look across the data can give a glimpse into why they made such a choice.</p>
<p><img alt="Mobile Usage 2013" src="http://www.stateofsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mobile-usage-2013.jpg" width="560" height="330"/></p>
<p>You can see the clear rise in Mobile devices from around 4% in January 2010 to actually superseding desktop briefly in May 2013 at 55%.</p>
<h3>Key Events:</h3>
Iphone was first released in June 2007
The first commercial Android Phone was released in 2008
Ipad (Tablet) was first released in April 2010
Google’s Nexus 7 Tablet was released in 2012
<p>So the Big data I have is a faction of what Google or the other big players are collecting just read <a href="http://www.stateofsearch.com/bloggers/blogger-bas-van-den-beld/" target="_blank">Bas’s</a> post “<a href="http://www.stateofsearch.com/spying-data/" target="_blank">Yes your being spied on</a>” but it does give us a guide on where things are headed.</p>
<h2>Where do tablets fit in?</h2>
<p>The graph below shows tablets and mobile devices separated as a percentage of visitors across the last 18 months.</p>
We can see a steady increase, separating the devices does show desktop is still currently dominant.
<p><img alt="Tablet Usage 2013" src="http://www.stateofsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tablet-usage-2013.jpg" width="560" height="330"/></p>
<h3>What is the Most Popular Device?</h3>
<p>The table below shows the percentage of visitors by device over the past six months, there is only really four two players.</p>
<strong>Mobile Device</strong>
<strong>%</strong>
iOS
58.7%
Android
35.8%
BlackBerry
3.0%
Windows Phone
2.0%
<p>The key to notice is the increase in Android usage, its predicted to be bigger than iOS, the graph below shows how it is changing. We see fluctuations in its usage but overall a steady increase.</p>
<p><img alt="Android Percentage" src="http://www.stateofsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/android-percentage-July-2013.jpg" width="560" height="330"/></p>
<p>The same can not be said for Tablet devices as iOS is still the far out leader.</p>
<strong>Tablet Device</strong>
<strong>%</strong>
iOS
91.2%
Android
8.3%
BlackBerry
0.3%
Linux
0.1%
<h2>Usage by Location</h2>
<p>It is important to note that the websites in my data set are UK based however the chart below shows the mobile usage of international visitors from the past 6 months.</p>
South Korea shows a clear dominance of Mobile.
<p><img alt="International Mobile Usage" src="http://www.stateofsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/international-visitors.jpg" width="560" height="330"/></p>
<p>That it for now, go and download some of your own data and let me now what it shows.</p>
