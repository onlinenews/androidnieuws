<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
<h3>The Admiral – Great Business Phone…</h3>
<p>                                                             April 5, 2012                </p>

                    After some dabbling around with different phones, I couldn’t pass up buying the Admiral phone for just one cent. I wanted something that was fit for business use with a real keyboard, tough construction and a good look and feel. What I ALSO got was scratch resistant Gorilla glass, a very strong battery and it’s pretty darn fast.
<p>If you’re coming from the BlackBerry world and need a keyboard with the popular Android operating system, look at the Admiral. It’s the right combination of performance, quality, price, app selection and more.                </p>
<h3>Great Phone!</h3>
<p>                                                             December 28, 2011                </p>

                    Just picked up this phone a few weeks back, and am absolutely loving it. A bit of background – the family was on Nextel for many years, and relied on the PTT Direct Connect to keep the family in touch quickly and easily. We used Nextel Blackberries. As data became more important, we shifted to the Sprint network and away from Nextel to take advantage of high speed data. We, however, missed the PTT feature in a big way, and have been looking for a way to get back onto it, but not at sacrifice the 3G speeds for data.
<p>We went to Android phones, but missed the PTT feature, and most importantly, the great Blackberry keyboard that was always there. No matter what, a man with decent size hands CAN NOT work a virtual keyboard well. The tactile response of a keyboard is just so much better than the touch screen. That being said, touchscreens were now pretty much standard in how many people (including myself) interact with their phones, and I really didn’t want to give that up either.</p>
<p>My wishlist for my next phone included a high quality touchscreen, longer battery life than my prior Android phone (or most for that matter), a PTT option, and of course, an always there, non-slider keyboard. The Admiral fits the bill perfectly. There are bigger screens, but this one is fantastic and of great quality. I can continue to enjoy the Android eco system and the apps I had before. I have a fantastic keyboard that allows me to compose emails and texts far faster than on any virtual keyboard.</p>
<p>Bottom line, this is the phone that I have been waiting for. I have yet to activate the PTT features, as the rest of the family’s phones do note yet have the Sprint PTT features, but as they get new phones, we will be going live with the PTT. Stock battery management features now are giving me a couple of days on a full charge with a decent level of usage. Great phone, love the Motorola quality, and looking forward to adding more of these to the family’s inventory!                </p>
<h3>Pleasantly Surprised</h3>
<p>                                                             August 14, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I was in desperate need of a new phone but didn’t know a lot about the phones that were available. When I went to the Sprint store looking for a phone, the price couldn’t have been better. Free! I was leary at first, but now that I have had it a while, I love it. The speaker quality is clear with no crackling, I don’t get any dropped calls. I wasn’t sure how I would like a touch screen but I do. I come from a real old school phone, and the only reason I replaced it was because my old one was obsolete. It’s not a complicated phone, it gives me what I want and need. The camera and video take awesome pictures as well.                </p>
<h3>Amazing Just what I was waiting for</h3>
<p>                                                             May 18, 2012                </p>

<p>                    this is an incredible phone i have seen some really bad reviews on this phone and i have to say that it might be that they don’t know how to use this phone it is the best phone in the market<br/>DC is fast i didnt notice a difference between nextel and sprint<br/>go buy this phone and enjoy                </p>
<h3>easy to use and get used to</h3>
<p>                                                             November 13, 2012                </p>

                    We use DC at my work, and since they’re getting rid of all the iden Nextel towers, I had to get rid of my $35 a month Boost Mobile phone regretfully. I was forced to switch to an Android phone with DC, so this was my only option.
<p>That being said, I have been pleasantly surprised by the Admiral; it made my transition from a cheap phone to paying just over $90/month very easy. I now love having what I would refer to as a computer at my fingertips. To me, the phone is very fast and I can surf the web and run any application very easily. Having a “smart phone” is fantastic, I doubt I could ever go back to a “dumb phone” now- didn’t realize how much I was missing. Texting and typing is a breeze like a Blackberry with the key pad. I never liked the touch screen idea, but having both a touch screen and keypad is wonderful; although I do like that ball that is on some Blackberrys.</p>
<p>At first I was not looking forward to spending well over $100 a month for a cell phone, but I now see the value in doing so with a phone this usable. I have the everything 450 plan and $10 data add on, so the bill comes out to $79.99/month, and after the fees it is just over $90 for me. I have auto pay set up so I believe that saves a little bit of money. Since all cell-to-cell calling, texting, and DC’ing, is free, and considering the free nights and weekends, I have not yet come close to exceeding the 450 mins.</p>
<p>I was skeptical of the $.01 cost from Amazon Wireless, and even called them no make sure there was not a catch, seeing as this phone sells for $100+ everywhere even with a contract. There in fact is not a catch, I just signed the contract and was charged an activation fee on my first bill. The person who I spoke to at Amazon Wireless was helpful, courteous, friendly, and intelligent.</p>
<p>The camera/video is sufficient. Use a steady hand, and sometimes it will distort colors especially in low light, but in my opinion it is adequate for being cell phone camera. I find myself taking pictures of everything now. I downloaded the “brightest flashlight” app, and I easily use it almost every day, the tiny led is extremely bright.</p>
<p>I would not call it military tough at all, I’ve seen others at my work drop them bad on pavement, and in some cases they were damaged severely and beyond repair. The screen does seem highly resistant to scratching, but I’ve also seen a shattered one. I have noticed a few tiny glitches, but they are very rare, and no where near as bad as any other phone I’ve used from Motorola- it’s a level of quality I am not used to from the company.</p>
<p>The general smoothness of usability, and the seemingly endless list of features could keep me talking about this phone all day, and I’m no techie. Overall I would buy this phone again and again, and would recommend one to a family member or anyone looking for a good smartphone, whether you need it for the DC or not.                </p>
<h3>Suits it’s intended purpose</h3>
<p>                                                             September 11, 2012                </p>

                    I have used this phone for almost 1 year. Decent call quality, easy email and gmail setup. If you are familiar with the android operating system the phone will be a snap. The direct connect is fairly similar to other nextel phones. Ringer volume isn’t quite as loud as I expected.
<p>A time or two the phone has froze up, simply putting it to sleep and waking it up stops this.</p>
<p>Cons: Seems to be a slight reception lag going from sprint towers to roaming towers.</p>
<p>I wish it had more RAM to run games.</p>
<p>Also broke the plastic cover over the camera lense the first week I had it. Get a good case to prevent this.</p>
<p>All in all, it meets my needs.                </p>
<h3>Great phone</h3>
<p>                                                             December 2, 2012                </p>

                    I have owned this phone for 6 months and am loving this phone.<br/>Pros:<br/>The keys are tilted in such a way that it makes typing on the keyboard easy. Notifications show up nicely at the top of the screen. camera functions are awesome and I love the panoramic shots. pictures are clear and easy to transfer my photo site. Push to talk feature is awesome. It is great to be able to notify when user is available as well which was not possible with our Nextels.
<p>Cons:<br/>would love to see bet texting capabilities. the voice texting does not work. When I ask to send message it brings up the send message screen but am unable to dictate my message without further navigation which makes this useless since i use this mostly while driving.                </p>
