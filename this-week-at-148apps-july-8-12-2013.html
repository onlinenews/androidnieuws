<h2>Celebrating the App Store’s 5th Anniversary</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>App Store Insiders</h3>
<p>First up, check out the <a href="http://www.148apps.com/category/news/app-store-insiders/">over 20 interviews</a> that Jeff Scott (with a little help from Carter Dotson) did with the App Store’s best and brightest, <a href="http://www.148apps.com/news/app-store-insiders-mike-lee-cofounder-tapulous-talks-responsibility-app-store/">like this one from Tapulous co-founder, Mike Lee</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-08-at-3.34.19-PM-221x300.png" alt="Mike Lee" width="221" height="300"/><b>148Apps:</b> If you have one single success within the App Store you’d like to highlight, what would it be?</p>
<p><b>Mike Lee:</b> I’m really excited about the work the New Lemurs are doing. I’ve been trying to blend technology and altruism both on and off the App Store since before it was a thing, with everything from the Club Thievey fundraising drive that linked Mac developers with the <a href="http://savethelemur.org">Madagascar Fauna Group</a> to the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/10/02/official-iphone-app-for-obama-08-now-in-app-store/" target="_blank">Obama ’08 app</a> to Appsterdam and on into Lemurs Chemistry.</p>
<p>What distinguishes my work now from what I was doing 5 years ago is this: while I’m still focused on providing great products and experiences to people, that has stopped being the end in and of itself. Now I am much more concerned with spreading good memes. My abilities as an App Maker, and my ability to be an example of what kind of apps we should make and what kind of App Makers we should be, have switched seats.</p>
<p>My current obsession is the idea that games would not be a waste of time if they were made based on science. By replacing the arbitrary game mechanics with rules from nature, you end up with games that happen to be educational as a side-effect, instead of trying to gamify education. <a href="http://le.mu.rs/chemistry">Lemurs Chemistry</a> is the embodiment of that idea, and it’s the best game I’ve ever produced.
</p>
<p>Be sure to read <a href="http://www.148apps.com/category/news/app-store-insiders/">all of the interviews</a>, chock full of insight and info, right here on 148Apps.</p>
<h3>Looking Back</h3>
<p>It was a special week across the <a href="http://www.148apps.com">148Apps</a> network of sites, as we celebrated the App Store’s 5th anniversary with a wealth of original content from our team of reviewers.  Take a look at some of their picks for the best apps from the past five years.</p>

<p> <br/><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/fairwaysolitaire1-600x400.jpg" alt="fairwaysolitaire1" width="600" height="400"/></p>
<p>In all my time playing iOS games, I’ve never been quite so tempted to buy an in-app purchase as I was while playing <em><a href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/fairway-solitaire-review/#ixzz2YwEdQFqI">Fairway Solitaire</a></em>. This isn’t because there’s so little content bundled with the free version (there’s enough) but because it’s so addictive that I didn’t want to stop playing. For a game that’s essentially a twist on card game solitaire, this is praise indeed. As the name suggests, <em><a href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/fairway-solitaire-review/#ixzz2YwEdQFqI">Fairway Solitaire</a></em> is a version of Golf Solitaire, a classic variation on the card game that everyone knows and loves. The difference here is that rather than create suits such as in regular Solitaire, the player must score runs by clearing the card deck using the least amount of moves. Once the pile of cards run out, the par is determined and the player moves onto the next hole. At the end of the course, a star rating out of three is offered as a way of encouraging players to master the stage. –<a href="http://www.148apps.com/author/jenallen/">Jennifer Allen</a></p>

<p> <br/><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rage.jpg" alt="rage" width="600" height="548"/></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/rage-bahamut-review/#ixzz2YwGfQlkd">Rage of Bahamut</a></em> wasn’t quite what I was expecting. It definitely involves collecting cards and battling other players, but it’s more akin to a browser game than what most would consider a “proper” iOS title. Whether or not this is a bad thing depends a lot on personal preference, but anyone willing to look past the clunky interface just might find themselves having a great time. At its core, <em><a href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/rage-bahamut-review/#ixzz2YwGfQlkd">Rage of Bahamut</a></em> is all about gathering cards in order to complete quests (or battle other players) in order to get better cards, etc. But that’s just the basics. Quests can be completed in order to acquire treasure, more cards, cash, and experience for whichever card has been designated the Leader. It’s all used as expected (i.e. buying car packs, building a stronger deck, etc), really.  –<a href="http://www.148apps.com/author/rob-rich/">Rob Rich</a></p>

<p> <br/><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/disc.jpg" alt="disc" width="600" height="389"/></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/disc-drivin-review/#ixzz2YwJNsHv7">Disc Drivin’</a></em> is a game whose immediate goal might not be apparent; the easiest way to explain the game is that it is like <em>Mario Kart</em> crossed with <em>Words With Friends</em>. You and your opponents take turns sliding your disc across the tracks, replete with tricky turns, turbo boosts, and powerup icons. The <em>Words with Friends</em>-esque element comes from the turn-based gameplay; when you take your turn, your opponent then takes theirs, and so on until someone completes 3 laps and wins the race. The game supports up to 8 players in either hotseat or local wifi multiplayer, and up to 4 people online, with push notifications notifying you when it is your turn. There’s a reason why I describe this as being similar to <em>Words With Friends</em> in particular, and it is because <em><a href="http://www.148apps.com/reviews/disc-drivin-review/#ixzz2YwJNsHv7">Disc Drivin’</a></em> is just as addictive and viral as that game was around its popularity peak. If you start up one game, you’ll quickly find yourself wanting to start up more and more, and anxiously waiting for your opponents to make their moves so you can play some more. The physics engine with the discs adds to the fun, as wacky things can happen when you hit ramps, bombs or other discs; there is plenty that can happen when discs go flying to cause you to shout for joy or shriek in error. You never know what you’ll see next. That, and just the whole addictive and surprisingly fast-paced nature of the asynchronous multiplayer, is what makes this one a gem.  –<a href="http://www.148apps.com/author/carter/">Carter Dotson</a></p>

<p> <br/><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tea-party.jpg" alt="tea party" width="600" height="508"/></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.giggleapps.com/reviews/toca-tea-party-review/">Toca Tea Party</a></em> is a wonderfully creative app from one of my new favorite developers, Toca Boca. This app creates a lovely interactive tea party environment which has become a huge hit with our entire family. This is a wonderful iPad app which simulates a tea party for three, be it a child and two adults, a child and two dolls or stuffed animals, or three toys with the help of little hands. This app has been enjoyed in our house in every conceivable way and I can say that my husband, son, and I all love this application.  –Amy Solomon</p>

<p> <br/><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/flyingbooks.jpg" alt="flyingbooks" width="600" height="480"/></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.giggleapps.com/reviews/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore-review/">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr Morris Lessmore</a></em> is a very special interactive storybook for iPad that is perfectly realized in every way. Strong words, I know, but this app is simply wonderful, poetic and beautiful experience for all ages. Based on the short film of the same name, this ebook has interwoven interactions and other animated visuals that are simply striking for use of imagery that will stay with the reader for a very long time. It is hard really to write this review as I would encourage readers to experience this themselves, as I don’t think my words here will do this app justice. The story is said to be inspired by hurricane Katrina, Buster Keaton, and the Wizard of Oz equally, and is about a man who is currently writing a book about his life. One day, his world gets turned upside down but is fortunate to later find a library filled with books with flying abilities that need a caregiver. In reality, this app is really about so much more. My son, at 3.5 years, still takes things on face value, and for him, this story book is about the love of reading and the warm embrace books deserve as the protagonist takes care of these flying books as if they are living, breathing things. –Amy Solomon</p>

<p>Beautiful, drop dead gorgeous 3D graphics. Relatively easy controls. Frankly who cares about backstory?<br/><em><a href="http://www.androidrundown.com/app-rundown/smash-spin-rage-review/">Smash Spin Rage</a></em> is a game that brings mythical elements to 21st century handheld gaming. It brings to bear murder, the supernatural and an unquenchable desire for revenge. I mostly like the graphics in this one. The colors avidly bring to life the spooky ambiance of the location, with natural light combining and contrasting with shadows at the same time. The animations are smooth, and the supernatural effects worked well. From the opening cutscene to the battles all the way to the creativity of the belligerents, the game looks good.  –<a href="http://www.androidrundown.com/author/tre-lawrence/">Tre Lawrence</a></p>

<p> <br/><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/stickfight.png" alt="stickfight" width="600" height="376"/></p>
<p>So many of us cut our gaming teeth on scrolling beat em ups. You know, those games like Fighting Force that gave us the opportunity to graphically beat up hordes of violent thugs. There was usually the simplest of backstory, plenty of swinging limbs and even a weapon or two to procure. <em><a href="http://www.androidrundown.com/app-rundown/ultimate-stick-fight-review/">Ultimate Stick Fight</a></em> is in that same glorious vein. Jumps, kicks, punches and tons of people to practice them on. And stick figures. Part of what sets this game apart is the look; instead of regular-looking characters, we get souped up, colorful stick people. Interestingly enough, the developer does well with colorization, and is able to imbibe a good deal of character into the thin guys. The movements and animations were fairly life-like, but kept the whimsical nature that we expect in characters of this genre. When matched with the numerous, creatively diverse backgrounds, it makes a pretty compelling 2D visual feast.  –<a href="http://www.androidrundown.com/author/tre-lawrence/">Tre Lawrence</a> </p>

<p> <br/><img src="http://www.148apps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/leaping.png" alt="leaping" width="600" height="376"/></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.androidrundown.com/app-rundown/leaping-legend-review/">Leaping Legend</a></em> is an arcade-style infinite climbing/running game. The virtual world is decidedly medieval, with the jittery characters and animations presented in 8-bit retro glory. As noted, all the elements come together to create a game with an arcade feel. The animations are fairly utilitarian, and do the job without being too flashy. If creating a remarkable ode to the past is the goal, I think the developer mostly succeeds admirably. In this one, the higher up one goes the better. Trying to free the fair-haired maiden at the “top” is the goal, and to accomplish this, our protagonist has two parallel walls to run up, as well as the ability to leap from one wall to the other on the quest to the top. This ability to leap is invaluable, as along the way, there are all sorts of run-ending obstacles, ranging from scary looking rotating blades to barrels and plenty of dropping debris.  –<a href="http://www.androidrundown.com/author/tre-lawrence/">Tre Lawrence</a></p>
