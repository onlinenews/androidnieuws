      <h1>All About Android 2</h1>
      <p><p>I'm very interested in purchasing my first android and could really use your help making that transition.
</p><p>Here's what's important to me in a mobile phone. I am most concerned about syncing my contacts and calendar items; having IMAP access to my gmail; syncing music and photos would be great but not as important.
I'm a Mac, iPhone 4, Address Book, iCal and Mobile Me user. It works very well for me. I hope there is a good way to switch my phone to an Android, preferably the Nexus S 4G on Sprint when it comes out.
</p><p>Can you please do a live demonstration on the show of how to move from iPhone to Android? How to sync the Mac Address Book and iCal to a Gmail account and then –most importantly– how to initiate 2way sync between a Mac (laptop), Google, and an android device. There seems to be a lot of YouTube video but I haven't found anything too helpful as of yet.
I think there are a lot of Mac/iPhone users who would make the switch if there was a solid way to accomplish the task. My biggest reservation is that Android won't be near the same user experience that I am accustomed to using iPhone/MobileMe.
Any help would be great and much appreciated!!
</p><p>Loved the first show, and glad to see you on the TWiT network.  My two
cents on the handset size question:  I have a fairly good-sized paw,
and never thought I could use a touch screen for typing.  I've been
using my Samsung Vibrant/Galaxy S for six months the size is perfect.
A 4"" screen fits in the pocket nicely, and I can still type when I
need to (though often I use the voice input).  The 4.3"" phones,
though, seem GINORMUS.  Such a little difference, yet the whole feel
of the handset is different.  Let's hope we keep having some range of
choice as the new devices come out, especially since I'll probably
have to get new hardware when AT&amp;T gobbles T-Mobile and I have to go
searching for a CDMA home.
