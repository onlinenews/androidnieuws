    KATY, TX, July 14, 2013 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Esteemed <a href="http://www.cincoranchdentist.com" target="_blank">dentists in Katy</a>, Drs. H. Darrell Hamon and Arnaud De Buyl, increase the accessibility of their dental practice through the launch of a mobile website. In today's busy world, Dr. Hamon and Dr. De Buyl take into consideration that time is of the essence. <br/><br/>
With the launch of the mobile website for Hamon, DeBuyl and Associates, DDS, LLP, patients can easily view the practice's website while on-the-go without having to scroll through multiple pages. Every month more and more people begin using the Internet on their phone to access an array of resources. This means an ever-increasing amount of web traffic is through mobile browsers, placing a high importance on the availability of a mobile friendly website. <br/><br/>
"To respect our patients' schedules, we are pleased to offer a new mobile website so patients don't delay an issue they may need to have addressed simply because of inaccessibility. Preventive care is the best investment as we partner with our patients to provide the highest level of dental care in order to reach optimum dental health," said Dr. Darrell Hamon, <a href="http://www.cincoranchdentist.com" target="_blank">Katy dentist</a>.<br/><br/>
The iPhone and Android browsers display websites differently than their desktop equivalents. For one thing, they are by nature smaller. For another, they don't support the same technology. Dr. Hamon, <a href="http://www.cincoranchdentist.com" target="_blank">dentist in Katy, TX</a>, ensures patients can easily access the practice website through their iPhone or Android browsers with the launch of a mobile website. <br/><br/>
With smartphones and tablets becoming more advanced, and the Internet available just about everywhere a person goes, it was Dr. Hamon and Dr. De Buyl's top priority to create a mobile friendly website so that patients don't miss out on valuable dental information. There is no question that mobile devices have become a staple in everyday living around the world. Now more than ever it is important that websites be optimized for mobile devices, and Dr. Hamon and Dr. De Buyl, <a href="http://www.cincoranchdentist.com" target="_blank">Katy, TX dentists</a>, have done just that. <br/><br/>
Dr. Darrell Hamon and Dr. Arnaud De Buyl, <a href="http://www.cincoranchdentist.com" target="_blank">Katy family dentists</a>, encourage their patients to visit the practice's mobile website whenever they have a question about dental health care. Through the easy accessibility of a mobile website, patients can receive the information they need to make well-informed dental health decisions. <br/><br/>

Hamon and De Buyl, <a href="http://www.drhamon.com/cosmetic-dentist-katy-tx.html" target="_blank">Katy cosmetic dentists</a>, treat their patients how they would want their own family to be treated. Patients are encouraged to visit the practice's convenient, new location in the heart of Cinco Ranch, which is convenient to Houston, Katy, Richmond and Sealy. <br/><br/>
