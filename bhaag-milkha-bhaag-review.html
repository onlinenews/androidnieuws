<h2>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Review: Script Analysis</h2>
<p>The film is an intelligently disguised story of a man whom history cannot faze out easily. Milkha Singh’s life story has the right ingredients for a clever biopic which Prasoon Joshi and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra have executed with delectable imagination. At no point does the film scatter in terms of story or intention, steering close to the relevant facts. Mehra rightfully reuses his <em>Rang De Basanti</em> style of narration which works to enhance the film’s tempo by absorbing your attention into it even more.</p>
<p>The story’s melodrama is restricted, keeping the dramatic bits plain. It is painful to see the Partition sequences of the story which have been carried out remarkably. In a particular sequence, where the young Milkha Singh slips on a puddle of blood after his entire ‘pind’ has been wiped off is the most fearsome portrayal of wretchedness! The story’s tainted scenes weave the haunting air fantastically and yet the cherishable moments maintain the story’s sheen. A couple of scenes are beyond the dimensions of cinematic marvel and ooze innocence wrapped in simplistic story telling!</p>
<p>From the glee of getting his first India blazer to when he loses the qualifying match in Melbourne to when he breaks down crying the pent up tears of years , the story’s terrain is smartly packed with judicious amounts of highs and lows, making the film’s recipe flawless.</p>
<h2>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Review: Star Performances<strong> </strong></h2>
<p>Farhan Akhtar has immersed in himself the soul of Milkha Singh. Giving the best work of his career, he is resplendent as Milkha Singh. He brings out Milkha’s vulnerability with charm and his passion with force. There is comfortable and effortless energy Farhan infuses in his role which makes me sure no one could have played it better than him. The actor will impress you with the work he has done in his physique. He has drawn a believable, grounded and exemplary picture of a man whose story people are less fluent with. With this unblemished portrayal, Farhan will astound you!</p>
<p>Sonam Kapoor has a lovely tinge in her little role in her limited screen time, she will flatter you enough that you actually feel bad that Milkha and Biro eventually part ways!</p>
<p>Divya Dutta plays Farhan’s older sister spotlessly well. A pillar of support and maternal love, she plays helplessness with command. A victim of domestic violence and marital rape, she paints the hues of her character commendably.</p>
<p>Pavan Malhotra shines through every scene with a first rate work and amazes you with his easy confidence.</p>
<h2>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Review: Direction, Music &amp; Technical Aspects</h2>
<p>After Delhi 6, Mehra faced a stark low and with Bhaag Milkha Bhaag he makes up as he has easily surpassed the high of Rang De Basanti too. His homage to the forgotten hero is an epic, with him caressing every detail with research and fondling every emotion through the film’s journey with tenderness. His storytelling still has the sparkling vision and his style has the ability to keep you latched to the screens. The story’s strength is in its reality and Prasoon Joshi has ensured that the screenplay rightfully fits in every bit coherently. The editing is so lucid that the 3 hour plus runtime isn’t tedious at any point. Joshi-Mehra with their skilled craftsmanship has weaved a tapestry of sheer compelling genius out of the life of a celebrated yesteryear sports personality! The background score by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy in wonderful and O Rangrezz croons with beauty!</p>
<h2>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Review: The Last Word</h2>
<p><em>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</em> will have you captivated with its grit and enigma. Made with panache, it’s hard to take your eyes off Farhan Akhtar, who enriches Milkha Singh as a surreal charismatic figure beyond the realms of flesh and blood! I am going with a 4/5 and applause for the film’s team. This one is so moving and scintillating that such films are a reward to the audiences for bearing through the fiascoes!</p>
