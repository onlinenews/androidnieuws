&#13;
				  	    NIS, SERBIA, July 12, 2013 /Home &amp; Family PR News/ -- Peaksel presents an application designed for men's best friends, dogs. "Dog Whistle" is one of the best applications for training dogs but also for those who are afraid of dogs and want a whistle that works as a dog repellent. <br/><br/><br/>&#13;
With this whistle a dog can learn new tricks. It can also make a dog stop barking or doing some disarray and became obedient and peaceful pet. It is finally time to relax and walk the dog wherever and whenever.<br/><br/>&#13;
The most common situation that happens to all the dog owners is to find their dogs running out into the street. There is no use yelling like crazy because the traffic noise is so loud and a dog cannot discern a man's voice from all the other sounds. The dog whistle is the only possible solution to this problem. <br/><br/><br/>&#13;
Human voice can vary depending on their emotions and is not so useful in dog training, while on the other hand a dog whistle sound is always constant. It is silent for people's ears, because the frequency of the sound it produces is 22000Hz and it is above the range of human hearing. <br/><br/>&#13;
"Dog Whistle is a necessary accessory for every dog owner. It facilitates training and daily walks, and becomes a modern "dog leash" which will help you never lose your pet dog," said Boban, one of the developers who became a real expert in dog training during the period of developing this application. "It is especially useful for hunters, because the whistle sound, together with voice commands and gestures makes an ideal way of training hounds. Hunting season is coming, it is better to be prepared on time."<br/><br/>&#13;
