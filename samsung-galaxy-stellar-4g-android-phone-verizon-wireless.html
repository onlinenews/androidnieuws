<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
<h3>I love it</h3>
<p>                                                             September 23, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I really love this phone. It takes great pictures everything processes really fast and the operation is smooth. An other feture i like about it that I didn’t have on my last android phone is on the home keys you can control apps running in the backround. Also I love that you can get it practactly for free. There is only about three things I don’t like about it and they are 1: no LED flash for the camera which I got used to on my old phone for a flash light, 2: It doesn’t have an 8 mega pixel camera which I am also used to, and 3: I think might just be a software issue because the phone is new which is when I try to log into my netflix app the keyboard won’t let me put my name and password correcty so I can use netflix on the phone like i did with my last phone.                </p>
<h3>Stellar phone at stellar price</h3>
<p>                                                             November 7, 2012                </p>

<p>                    Really good phone at a really good price (free). Good battery life, runs well on Verizon 4 g, one star off because camera is lacking slightly. Comparable to an iPhone 4.                </p>
<h3>The best smartphone I have ever owned.</h3>
<p>                                                             May 14, 2013                </p>

<p>                    Before this phone I had the DROID X, which I loved. Then I got this and noticed a major difference in processor and data speed. This phone is amazing with games and apps that didn’t work very well on my DROID X. The camera on the phone is okay, but would be a lot better with flash, but I got over that pretty fast. So overall this is a wonderful phone that is very fast and user friendly.                </p>
<h3>Great phone for the price</h3>
<p>                                                             April 9, 2013                </p>

<p>                    I expected a lot from a Samsung phone and this device has delivered. Beautiful, bright display and the OS (Jelly Bean) is very user friendly. I started out in “starter mode” and now I’m in “standard mode”. Only problem is the camera (only 3.2 mp). Other than that, this phone is a winner for me. It’s a keeper!                </p>
<h3>Excellent Little Smartphone!</h3>
<p>                                                             June 23, 2013                </p>

<p>                    I have had this phone for 5 months and not the first problem.<br/>The phone does everything I want a phone to do from making simple phone calls and texts to online browsing, social networking, weather warning apps etc and it is GREAT for running emulators of classic videogame consoles.<br/>No complaints whatsoever and the battery life is unbelievable.                </p>
<h3>Amazing for it’s price!</h3>
<p>                                                             October 18, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I just got this phone 2 days ago, it is really cool! It’s super easy to use and it has awesome battery life it can last for about 7-8 hours. If i were you i would pick from a stellar instead of a iPhone 4 8-gigabyte. Overall if your looking for a free phone pick the galaxy stellar. I am Chris’s son Ian,13 years old.                </p>
