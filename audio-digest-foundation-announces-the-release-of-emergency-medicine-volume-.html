Glendale, CA (PRWEB) July 11, 2013<br/><br/>&#13;
Audio-Digest Foundation announces the release of Emergency Medicine Volume 30, Issue 09: Oncologic Emergencies.<br/><br/>&#13;
The goal of this program is to improve management in the emergency department of patients with illnesses or conditions related to cancer or cancer treatment. After hearing and assimilating this program, the clinician will be better able to:<br/><br/>&#13;
1. Diagnose patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura.<br/>&#13;
2. Identify symptoms and progression of symptoms typical of epidural spinal cord compression.<br/>&#13;
3. Survey appropriate treatment options for patients with hyperleukocytosis syndrome.<br/>&#13;
4. Determine when superior vena cava syndrome is an emergency, based on the anatomic location of the lesion.<br/>&#13;
5. Assess techniques for managing urate and phosphate levels in patients with tumor lysis syndrome.<br/><br/>&#13;
The original programs were presented by David Barnes, MD, Assistant Clinical Professor of Emergency Medicine and Residency Program Director, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine.<br/><br/>&#13;
Audio-Digest Foundation, the largest independent publisher of Continuing Medical Education in the world, records over 10,000 hours of lectures every year in anesthesiology, emergency medicine, family practice, gastroenterology, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, oncology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, otolaryngology, pediatrics, psychology, and urology, by the leading medical researchers at the top laboratories, universities, and institutions.<br/><br/>&#13;
Recent researchers have hailed from Harvard, Cedars-Sinai, Mayo Clinic, UCSF, The University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, The University of Kansas Medical Center, The University of California, <a name="kp" href="/topic/san_diego.htm" title="San Diego">San Diego</a>, The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine, The University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and many others.<br/><br/>&#13;
Out of these cutting-edge programs, Audio-Digest then chooses the most clinically relevant, edits them for clarity, and publishes them either every week or every two weeks.<br/><br/>&#13;
In addition, Audio-Digest publishes subscription series in conjunction with leading medical societies: DiabetesInsight with The American Diabetes Association, ACCEL with The American College of Cardiology, Continuum Audio with The American Academy of Neurology, and Journal Watch Audio General Medicine with Massachusetts Medical Society.<br/><br/>&#13;
