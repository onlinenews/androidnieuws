<p>As of today, the players of Sports Car Challenge can enjoy this uncompromising roadster on their smartphones and tablets simply by updating their app. Merging elegant design, high-end performance and trend-setting innovation, the Porsche Boxster S shows its drivers what it is like to feel the airflow on the skin when speeding along the asphalt with more than 170mph. With its classy design that marks a unique blend of great tradition and innovative ideas, the Porsche Boxster S combines the best elements of more than 50 years of automotive engineering at its best. While its rolling side line underlines the racy attitude of this one-of-a-kind sports car, its distinct fenders refer to the legendary 718 RS 60 Spyder – a true classic of Porsche’s illustrious line-up of cars, which had been equally successful in long distance races and hill climb championships during its heyday in the late 1950s and early 1960s. </p>
<p>All players eager to kick the pedal to the metal can now experience the Porsche Boxster S in Sports Car Challenge entirely free of charge. All they need to do to get hold of this one-of-a-kind sports car is updating their app or downloading the game.</p>

In addition, the adrenaline-pumping racing experience also contains five individual race tracks and three differing gameplay modes. With an average of 10 gaming sessions per player and a total running time of more than 8 million hours, Sports Car Challenge has successfully delivered the ultimate driving experience on mobile to millions of players from all over the world.</p>
