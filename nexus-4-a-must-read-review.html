<p>After it acquired Motorola, Google has not released devices without approval. When it comes to promoting the Android platform as an independent OS, Google has followed Microsoft. It has tried to remain fair by having Nexus models developed by diverse companies that are licensed and has the power to build the product. Among the many companies involved, LG participated to build its latest version. Without the disappointments of many customers, the former Nexus 4 devices, within no time were sold out. The second sign was the availability of the unit from December 6th, but was again unavailable before Christmas. As seen objectively, this comes with no surprise. The selling point is the combination of high-tech hardware and low price.</p>
<p>The most recent update of Google’s Nexus devices is the Google Nexus 4, which is manufactured by LG. Even though the previous Nexus devices have already pushed the boundaries of the Smartphone’s sector, it introduces a package of high-end specs which are unseen on portable devices. The Google Nexus 4 has a different approach, it integrates a collection of finest specs found on the market.</p>
Google Nexus 4: Design
<p>Google Nexus 4 has a standard design of Nexus Smartphone. It characterizes by curved edges with no hardware keys at the front. The Nexus 4 embraces a 4.7-inch with a 1280×768 display.  It has 320 pixels per inch which makes the images vivid and bright. LG believes that wider features always prevent the problem of not being able to reach the screen. The video also looks smooth and sharp.  Its glass back panel has a 3D pattern that sparkles under the light. Its display is aligned with a thin chrome strip, which is similar to other phones.</p>

<h2 justify="">Google Nexus 4: Performance and Battery</h2>
<p>Under the hood of Google Nexus 4, there’s a Quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with 2GB of RAM for back up. Well LG and Google can turn their heads up since they have an impressively seedy phone. When it comes to connectivity, you will find a standard fare of WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth, making sure that the Smartphone does not need wires. Just like the battery of Samsung Galaxy S3, if used within the standard range (browsing, texts, and calls), the Google Nexus 4 can last days after usage without any hassles.</p>
<h3 justify="">Google Nexus 4: Hardware</h3>
<p>Google Nexus 4 is manufactured by LG Optimus G, therefore the two have mutual hardware specs. It comes with a 1280x768p resolution, 318ppi pixel density and IPS screen that has 4.7-inch True HD.

Drag-app-to-delete is another new feature, wherein the long press is needed in the menu. Google has also included voice typing on its mobile operating system. You do not need steady internet connectivity to use the feature completely. While sending an email or SMS, you just need to click the mic icon and start speaking. Overall, the phone is extremely smooth and equipped with few Google apps, like the Chrome browser, Maps, Currents, Messenger, YouTube and Play Books.</p>
Google Nexus 4: Camera and Audio
<p>Google Nexus 4 comes with an 8MP camera with LED flash. Its shooter isn’t the best, but the color is good, since the images are grainy. At the rear is an 8MP camera that comes with LED flash, while the front is 1.3MP.</p>
