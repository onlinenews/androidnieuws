Ryan Giggs<br/><br/><b>Simon Stone</b> � 14 July 2013<br/><br/>
The long-serving <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FManchester_United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> star will break new ground in the 2013/14 campaign after agreeing to join <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FDavid_Moyes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">David Moyes</a>' backroom team.<br/><br/>
Practically speaking, it means Giggs will start getting more involved in team meetings rather than assisting Moyes with his work on the training ground.<br/><br/>
For Giggs believes he still has a major contribution to make on the pitch, his hunger for success not sated, even after 22 years and 13 <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FBarclays_Premier_League" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Premier League</a> titles.<br/><br/>
"Crazy, aren't I?" the 39-year-old said. "I'm enjoying it just as much as I did 20 years ago. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>
"Every year is a bonus to me. Take last year: winning the league, that feeling you have after the hard work you put in. Winning that trophy makes it all worthwhile."<br/><br/>
Giggs accepts there is a balancing act to perform, even though his twin role is not entirely an alien concept.<br/><br/>
Twelve months ago <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FStuart_Pearce" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stuart Pearce</a> asked Giggs to do a very similar thing for the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FGreat_Britain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Great Britain</a> Olympic squad.<br/><br/>
It is a life after <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FFootball_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">football</a> Giggs is taking admirable care to prepare for, even flying to Turkey this summer to go through more work on his coaching badges.<br/><br/>
However, for now, his time will need to be managed very carefully.<br/><br/>
"I am excited about it personally and it has worked well so far," the Welshman said.<br/><br/>
"But it is about getting the balancing act right because I am still playing. There is not a big emphasis on coaching at the moment.<br/><br/>
"The manager likes to coach and there is Jim Lumsden, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FSteve_Round" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Round</a> and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FPhil_Neville" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Phil Neville</a>. It is more looking behind the scenes and seeing how everything works.<br/><br/>
"It is completely different from playing. Even though I have been playing for 20-odd years, I am seeing the other side of it; how you prepare for games.<br/><br/>
"Some things I knew, others I didn't. It has been a real education."<br/><br/>
Giggs has been spoken of as a potential United manager of the future, even though he has never managed at any level.<br/><br/>
With <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FPhil_Neville" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Neville</a> and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FNicky_Butt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nicky Butt</a> also on board and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FPaul_Scholes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Scholes</a> mulling over whether he wants to stay involved as well, the core of the side that brought United so much success down the years remains a major influence.<br/><br/>
Yet the man who guided them through is no longer around.<br/><br/><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FAlex_Ferguson" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> is presently on a cruise around Scotland.<br/><br/>
For the first time in his club career, Giggs is having to get used to a new voice.<br/><br/>
"It is strange for someone like myself, who has known him for so long," he said.<br/><br/>
"It's different, but you just get on with it. It is important to look forward, not back.<br/><br/>
"This is the start of the journey this season and I hope to be lifting a trophy again at the end of it."<br/><br/><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FRobin_van_Persie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robin van Persie</a>, David De Gea and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FAntonio_Valencia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Antonio Valencia</a> are expected to link up with United on the second leg of their pre-season tour which surprisingly opened with a 1-0 defeat to Singha All Stars in <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchtopics.independent.ie%2Ftopic%2FBangkok" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bangkok</a> yesterday.<br/><br/>
After coming off a long journey and having only 10 hours sleep in three days, Giggs was not too down at the outcome.<br/><br/>
And there were reasons to be positive in the performances of new boy Wilfried Zaha, while, like most observers, Giggs was enthused by the performance of 18-year-old Belgian Adnan Januzaj.<br/><br/>
"Adnan is talented," Giggs said. "He has shown his talent in training because he has trained with us quite a bit in pre-season. Now he has done well in a match situation.<br/><br/>
"He looks a really good prospect and will gain a lot of experience by playing in front of such big crowds.<br/><br/>
"He is only young and you don't want to get ahead of yourself. Now it is just about learning from the older players and doing what he does best."<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Firish-independent-news%2Fid335158729%3Fls%3D1%26amp%3Bmt%3D8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.independent.ie/editorial/images/logo-itunes.jpg" border="0" alt=""/></a>Download our Free iPhone App Now<br/><br/><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.feedhenry.fhjjjn7In7fqJG2LHTv3LVLanX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.independent.ie/editorial/images/playstore.png" border="0" alt=""/></a>Download our Free Android App Now<br/><br/><br/><img src="http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-89EKCgBk8MZdE.gif" border="0" alt=""/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.independent.ie/sport/crazy-ryan-giggs-relishing-new-united-role-29419068.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">More...</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a>&#13;
