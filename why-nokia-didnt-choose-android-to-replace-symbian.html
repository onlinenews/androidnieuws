I bought it because I'm a Windows Phone user, and despite its major flaws, I still hate WP much less than I hate its competitors. As such, it made sense to me that I would like the Surface RT as well - I mean, my favourite UI on a tablet? Count me in! It should come as no surprise by now that Windows RT was a major disappointment, so now that the Windows 8.1 preview is here, did Microsoft address any of the major problems?

It's Gregory Eric Sanderson. Congratulations, Gregory!

This roundup included Chrome 27, Firefox 22, IE10, and Opera 12, along with the new Chromium-based build of Opera Next (alos known as Opera 15).

				<a href="/topics/5"><img src="http://www.osnews.com/images/icons/5.gif" alt="Editorial" title="Editorial"/></a>Like many of you, I've been watching the big changes in user interfaces over the past few years, trying to make sense of them all. Is there a common explanation for the controversies surrounding the Windows 8 UI and Unity? Where do GNOME 3, KDE, Cinnamon, and MATE fit in? This article offers one view.

				<a href="/topics/9"><img src="http://www.osnews.com/images/icons/9.gif" alt="Linux" title="Linux"/></a>I volunteer as tech support for a small organization. For years we relied on Ubuntu on our desktops, but the users didn't like it when Ubuntu switched to the Unity interface. This article tells about our search for a replacement and why we decided on Xfce running atop Linux Mint.

				<a href="/topics/17"><img src="http://www.osnews.com/images/icons/17.gif" alt="PDAs, Cellphones, Wireless" title="PDAs, Cellphones, Wireless"/></a>So, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323393804578555783340654630.html">Microsoft was very close to take over Nokia</a>, but that the talks eventually broke down, probably beyond repair - at least for now. The reasons the talks broke down illustrate something that I have repeatedly tried to make clear for a long time now: Nokia isn't doing well.<a href="/comments/27121">OS X 10.9 Mavericks</a>

				<a href="/topics/41"><img src="http://www.osnews.com/images/icons/41.gif" alt="Mac OS X" title="Mac OS X"/></a>The third and final WWDC product I want to talk about is - of course - <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/">OS X 10.9 Mavericks</a>. While iOS 7 was clearly the focus of this year's WWDC, its venerable desktop counterpart certainly wasn't left behind. Apple announced OS X 10.9 Mavericks, the first OS X release not to carry the name of a big cat.

				<a href="/topics/14"><img src="http://www.osnews.com/images/icons/14.gif" alt="Apple" title="Apple"/></a>We already talked about iOS 7 yesterday (after a night of sleep, it's only looking worse and worse - look at <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BMesIG0CQAIxSrJ.png">this</a>, for Fiona's sake!), so now it's time to talk about the downright stunning and belly flutters-inducing new <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. As former owner and huge, huge, huge fan of the PowerMac G4 Cube - I haven't been this excited about an Apple product since, well, I would say the iMac G4. This is the Apple I used to love.<a href="/comments/27115">Apple unveils iOS 7</a>

				<a href="/topics/17"><img src="http://www.osnews.com/images/icons/17.gif" alt="PDAs, Cellphones, Wireless" title="PDAs, Cellphones, Wireless"/></a>Apple held its big keynote event thing at WWDC earlier this evening, but since I was away with friends I've had to read up on it later in the evening. The company announced iOS 7, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and they gave a preview of the new Mac Pro. Especially the Mac Pro impressed me, and while iOS 7's new Holo/Metro-inspired theme looks messy and garish to me, I do commend Apple for finally breaking the mold. This news item will focus on <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/">iOS 7</a> - I'll dive into the Mac Pro and OS X 10.9 tomorrow (it's late here now).

				<a href="/topics/44"><img src="http://www.osnews.com/images/icons/44.gif" alt="Legal" title="Legal"/></a>And yes, the PRISM scandal is far, far from over. More and more information keeps leaking out, and the more gets out, the worse it gets. The companies involved have sent out official statements - often by mouth of their CEOs - and what's interesting is that not only are these official statements eerily similar to each other, using the same terms clearly designed by lawyers, they also directly contradict <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-bristling-concede-to-government-surveillance-efforts.html">new reports from The New York Times</a>. So, who is lying?
