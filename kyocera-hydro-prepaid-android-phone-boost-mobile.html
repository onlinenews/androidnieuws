It offers nationwide service on the Nationwide Sprint Network and Nextel National Network, reaching more than 278 million people, with no activation or long-distance fees.<br/>
Plans include:<br/>
$55 Android Monthly Unlimited for unlimited nationwide talk, text, web, e-mail, and 411 with no contracts on an Android powered device. Includes access to Android Market. Voicemail, long distance and call waiting included. And you'll reduce your monthly payment the longer you stay with Shrinkage.</p>
<p>$2 Daily Unlimited provides all the value of Monthly Unlimited and nationwide coverage at a low daily rate. The $2 subscription charge is automatically deducted from your Boost account each day after midnight, regardless of usage, unless the you cancel the subscription. Recharge at least once every 90 days to keep your account active (after 90 days any credit balance will expire).</p>
<p>International Connect provides unlimited international talk and text with family and friends around the world. It can be added to Monthly Unlimited and Android Monthly Unlimited plans for an additional $5 per month, and added to the BlackBerry Monthly Unlimited plan for $10 per month.<br/>

All Monthly Unlimited plans include Shrinkage and unlimited nationwide talk, text, web, e-mail, and 411. Shrinkage reduces your payment by $5/month for every six on-time payments, up to $15/month in total. Android Monthly Unlimited to as low as $40/month.<br/>
On-Time Payments<br/>
On-time payments are made on or before the monthly payment date. Your monthly payment date remains the same every month as long as you successfully make your monthly payment. However, if you make a late payment, your payment date will be reset to the day of the month before the date your service is restored (e.g., if your service is restored on February 15th, your monthly payment date will be reset to March 14th).<br/>
Missed Payment<br/>
While it's best to make regular on-time payments each month, payments do not have to be consecutive. If you miss a payment you don't have to start over. The on-time payments made to the account will still be available as well as any savings milestone achieved.<br/></p><h2>Technical Details</h2>

<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
<h3>A Bit of a One-Trick Pony…but What a Trick!</h3>
<p>                                                             August 19, 2012                </p>

                    First of all, let’s get the “negative” points of this smartphone out of the way, front-and-center:
<p>- The Hydro lacks 4G capability.</p>
<p>- The screen is relatively small (by contemporary standards), and of moderate resolution.</p>
<p>- You get “only” a 1gHz, single-core processor. Heavy gamers won’t be pleased.</p>
<p>- The 3.2MP camera (rear-facing-only) isn’t much to write home about.</p>
<p>Now, on to the meat of the matter: as a freelance IT person, I’ve set up scores of iPhones (from the first version up to the 4S), and any number of Android phones for clients needing help getting their heads wrapped around their new, pocketable devices. Me? I hardly felt the need for that much mobile firepower: as a long-retired gamer, I wasn’t terribly seduced by large, high-res screens (that’s what laptops and tablets are for, right?), and I hardly get off on the idea of watching a feature-length movie on a 4.3-inch screen, high-def or not. I was more than happy with a BlackBerry Curve for my needs (“needs” being defined in my case as: e-mail, texting, IM, Web/data…and, usually, just placing and taking calls wherever I happen to be…yes, a phone!). “A tool, not a toy” has long been my mantra.</p>
<p>That changed a bit when I discovered that the BlackBerry platform doesn’t play well with IMAP-based e-mail. I discovered this when I moved to a Gmail account and wanted to take advantage of IMAP’s features. (I won’t delve into the niceties of IMAP here, so at the risk of sounding rude, Just Bleeping Google It.) The long and short of it is that RIM was of no help to me, and the problem was beyond the realm of my cellular carrier (Boost Mobile). I wanted to stick with my carrier, but what was I going to do?</p>
<p>I’d taken a glance at various Android phones for the better part of a year. Found nothing compelling, and all the phones seemed to cost at least a bit more than I was willing to shell out at a given time. I didn’t care a lot about having the biggest screen or the highest resolution; nice as those are, I’d just be paying for stuff that didn’t matter much in the main. I *did* care a bunch about e-mail, and it made sense that since Google was responsible for both the Android OS *and* Gmail, it was a no-brainer that the two would meld quite well. But I decided to sit on the fence and suffer quietly with my Curve. (Someone told me “Hey, you can just access Gmail from your ‘Berry’s browser, right?” Right, except that, if you know anything about the BlackBerry, you also know that doing this totally negates the main reason for sticking with the platform in the first place.)</p>
<p>Along comes the Hydro. The “killer app” for me in this phone’s specs wasn’t an app at all: this phone was spec’d as watertight, at least down to a meter in water. I’ve killed at least one phone by drowning, and I’m generally a LOT more careful handling my phones than most people I’ve observed. This feature alone could overshadow shortcomings such as a lack of 4G or a humongous, max-res screen. It means I can whip the thing out in a driving thunderstorm (or, less dramatically, in the middle of taking a shower), and not fear subjecting the phone to a premature death. It simply makes the phone *useful* in more situations, and under more (and more adverse) conditions than other smartphones…in this case more than almost *any* other smartphone you can name.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: The Hydro is pleasantly light, by way of casing that’s entirely plastic. It doesn’t have the “sexy” heft or look as a phone with metal wrapping around it, but I’ll take light weight (with some structural integrity) over “sexy” (which is subjective, anyway) any day of the week. I will say the Hydro is anything but an eyesore: the worst you might say about it is that it looks somewhat ordinary. Hardly a sin in my mind.</p>
<p>The screen is of decent size, and moderate in resolution, yet quite legible; Web pages come up with reasonable contrast and color, and page downloading, while not lightning-quick, is certainly fast enough for general purposes. Brightness is adjusted automatically based on ambient lighting conditions.</p>
<p>The touch-screen interface is pleasant to use. Note that the Hydro does have off-screen touch-controls at the phone’s bottom, even though the latest iterations of the Android OS have largely done away with the need for such ancillary controls. They seem to work well.</p>
<p>And, speaking of the OS: the Hydro comes loaded with Android 4.0.4 (code-named Ice Cream Sandwich…I rather like that name). My exposure to previous iterations of Android have been somewhat limited, but I can say that the overall “feel” of the OS is pleasantly smooth and responsive, and the downloading, launching and moving-around of apps exposed nothing in the way of untoward behavior thus far.</p>
<p>And, those apps…well over half a million so far. Still a fair count behind the iPhone, but as something of an Apple fanboy myself I can tell you that the Android platform has moved well past the “just a contender among many” stage and swinging it’s weight just fine, thank you.</p>
<p>As I said, no 4G here…but there’s 3G, which does the job rather well (this in spite of Sprint’s somewhat-spotty rep in terms of 3G network performance), and wi-fi, and Bluetooth, as well as wi-fi hotspot capability. BT pairing with my Motorola HX-1 headset was painless, although getting the phone to play nice with my Apple AirPort Extreme took a little doing. (Hint: If you haven’t done it in a while, check your wireless router for software/firmware updates, and download/install them when available. If not, simply restart the router…that often does the trick.) Overall reception was somewhat better than my BlackBerry Curve 8530, but as the saying goes, YMMV.)</p>
<p>(9/29/12 Addendum: I recently purchased a BlueAnt T1 Bluetooth headset to try out with the Hydro: so far, so good, although one problem I discovered with both headsets is that the voice-dial command voice from the phone – the voice that says “speak now”, among other things – is rather low in volume, with no means of adjustment by the user. I’ve contacted Kyocera about this, since it appears to be an issue with the Voice-Dial app, not the phone itself, and I’ve been told a fix is in the works. Hardly a deal-breaker IMO, but the fix will make an already pretty-solid phone superb.)</p>
<p>Then there’s the price: almost silly-cheap. If you’re already using a BlackBerry on Boost, you’re in for a treat: normally, buying the phone in-person entails an extra charge for set-up and such; In my case, they simply sold me the phone, transferred my account and had me set up in minutes, no extra charge. Couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p>(9/29/12 Addendum: One other “bonus” to not having stuff like 4G or a large, max-res screen is battery life: I’ve typically gone for over seven hours, utilizing the phone’s various functions, and managed to run the battery down to about 25% or so of remaining capacity – rather good stats, compared to most razzle-dazzle phones out out there. Kyocera’s included Eco app helps out here.)</p>
<p>Proverbial Bottom Line: if you value function over sheer entertainment value, I can safely say Kyocera’s Hydro packs quite a bit of value for the bucks. Don’t let the “entry-level” remarks of upcoming reviews scare you off: unless you *have* to have big-screen bling or that sexy silver band to wrap your anxious hands around, I’d say this phone rocks hard enough in its own quiet way. And when you and your friends are stuck in the rain and someone needs to call a car service to save the day, *you* get to play DareDevil without worry.</p>
<p>(UPDATE 02/04/13 – Six Months Out: So far, no major surprises…there have been a few app-related glitches here and there, but nothing especially aggravating. Kyocera just released a firmware/software upgrade which I installed today; So far, the most I can detect is a mild kick in speed, similar to when I’ve performed firmware upgrades in computers and such. It’s taken some rain, some snow, and a few drops to the floor – in and out of the case I bought for it – and it’s hanging tough.)                </p>
<h3>Awesome Phone!</h3>
<p>                                                             October 26, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I bought this for my wife who was using a non smart phone from Boost. I already have been using a Samsung Galaxy Prevail for the past year so I thought I would try out the Kyocera for her. I can saw wow to this phone in comparison to my prevail! The storage has tons compared to my Prevail, it flies, has a bigger screen and is water resistant! I bought her a purple plastic and rubber protective case on Amazon and it looks nice. I like this phone so much, I bought one and it is on the way! I got it on sale for $99 and I will be retiring the Galaxy Prevail! I am not a smart phone guru by any means and all I have to compare it to is my Samsung and there is no comparison! I really like the Ice Cream Sandwich and am blown away by how voice mail is transferred to text so no more calling, entering stuff and going through call after call. I can’t put it down! Every app that I have on my Galaxy runs way way faster on the Kyocera! THUMBS UP!                </p>
<h3>Waterproof Smartphone!</h3>
<p>                                                             August 29, 2012                </p>

                    Recieved mine 2 days ago and I am totally jazzed.
<p>Its got more than what Id expect in a $129 phone: ICS, 1ghz, and the screen reads well in daylight. Its light, travels easy in the pocket &amp; does the web well.</p>
<p>Now the waterproof thing is really cool. Drop it in water, dunk it, leave it. It totally works &amp; goes against all my mental training over the past 10 years on how to treat a phone. The touchscreen is suprisingly responsive when wet (not perfect) but I can see myself trying underwater video this weekend. And Im stoked I dont have to have a big bulky phone to get waterproofed as Ive seen before.</p>
<p>Well done.                </p>
<h3>Not bad for a touch screen</h3>
<p>                                                             September 19, 2012                </p>

                    The water proof feature is what was the deciding factor on purchasing this phone, plus the low price.<br/>I’ve dunked a couple phones in water before, totally ruining them &amp; when I saw this one, it was ideal for me. Accidents do happen, so this is a just in case…<br/>Eco mode is great to conserve battery space (without it I have to plug in at least 2 times or else battery will die fast) I text &amp; facebook often throughout the day &amp; have a few apps installed.<br/>Sound quality on calls is great.<br/>The screen has a nice resolution for a prepaid phone.<br/>Music player installed (great bonus)<br/>Headphone jack on top.<br/>For some reason this phone has a better signal than my other Boost mobile phone did. (another great plus)<br/>This phone really did exceed my expectations considering the low price &amp; it being a prepaid phone (contract phones are usually nicer).<br/>Honestly I do wish to have left my contract sooner (6 yrs being on contract with Sprint) and gone to Boost Mobile sooner! The monthly rates with Shrinkage are awesome &amp; this phone is priced so well to be a great phone.<br/>I am a text, social networking, sometimes calling, love the new technology person &amp; I must say that I am happy with this phone.<br/>My only complaint is the battery life is short for texting &amp; social networking, otherwise it holds up well to phone calls (in eco mode)
<p>Great phone. Price can’t be beat. Love the fact that it didn’t come with all the annoying apps pre installed that take up space.                </p>
<h3>Why not?</h3>
<p>                                                             August 27, 2012                </p>

<p>                    I agree with everything the first two reviewers mentioned. I got it just yesterday, but my first impressions are encouraging. I’m 31 now and realize I don’t need a phone that I can play games on, don’t need 4G, ect. This is a great little phone that does what I need it to: take calls, sent text messages, manage my email, and occasionally visit the web. Easy, simple, and best thing is the device is extremely inexpensive. And waterproof..?.. Forget about it, done deal. So far so good. Hope y’all enjoy it too…                </p>
<h3>Great Value</h3>

<p>                    This phone is quite a bargain like Barrett said. It gives you a 1 Ghz processor, Android 4.0.4, and water resistance all in a light-weight package. The screen’s resolution is mediocre, but its size makes it easy to carry in a pocket unlike larger “bling” phones. This is quite a step up from the Nokia E71 that I was using with another famous prepaid carrier.                </p>
<h3>Great for the money</h3>

                    I researched pre-paid phones for about 2 months before I bit the bullet and made my purchase. I knew I wanted an android and I was torn between the Kyocera Rise and Hydro. I went with the Hydro purely because of Boost’s shrinking monthly plans. After having the phone for 2 1/2 weeks I feel ready to share my opinion on how excited this phone makes me.
<p>My biggest complaint about the Hydro is battery life purely because I’m always on the go, HOWEVER you must realize that any smartphone is always “thinking” checking your email, facebook, and everything else you have directly linked to it. So my solution was to keep a charger in my bag and I charge it when I’m at work and in the car.</p>
<p>It is surprisingly fast even on the network. The processor works quicker than I expected. The reviews on cnet said it was slow for the processor it had.</p>
<p>I haven’t tested the water resistance yet purely because if it does happen I don’t have proper insurance to back it up. I did get a 1 year best buy protection plan on it though for just in case.</p>
<p>All in all I have a great inexpensive phone that does everything I need without the hassle of a contract. I would gladly recommend this to any person.</p>
<p>****Editing to note******</p>
<p>I have tested the water resistant feature. It is water resistant. I dropped in the foot bath while I was getting a pedicure, the lady was driving me crazy telling me to be careful, so I dropped it to shut her up. I’ve put it in a pitcher of water to show my co-workers it is water resistant.</p>
<p>The touchscreen is VERY touchy. I do frequently mute calls while I’m talking, solution, use a blue tooth headset.</p>
<p>Certain apps are NOT compatible with this model, so I got over it and didn’t download them.</p>
<p>****EDITING AGAIN TO NOTE******</p>
<p>The water resistant feature does work, however, if the speaker gets saturated you have to wait for it to dry out or you can’t hear your phone calls for approximately 24 hours. It doesn’t effect the working order of the phone the speaker just needs time to dry out before you can hear or it sounds really muffled. Again, if you use a blue tooth headset this doesn’t apply to you.                </p>
<h3>First smart phone and I LOVE it!</h3>
<p>                                                             March 18, 2013                </p>

                    I was using the crappy Motorola Theory before (Yuk!) I’m a nursing student and my instructors post important documents/announcements on the school website and texting us when we have to meet at the hospital so when I started searching for a phone I knew I NEEDED one that I could forward my school email to, access the school’s websites (the full page, not the terrible mobile version,) plus I was in the market for a recorder to record lectures. After doing EXTENSIVE research on multiple sites I bought the Kyocera Hydro on December 8, 2012. It is now 3/18/2013 and I’m still quite happy with my Hydro!
<p>BODY: The body of the phone itself is sleek, black, with a rough texture on the back cover. It is also (like every other cell phone) SLIPPERY so buy a cover/case! I will never understand all the reviews I read before buying that complained about the way the phone LOOKS. Who gives a flying crap when the majority of the original phone will be covered?! I bought a nice bright rubbery green cover and the phone is well protected. The Screen is a nice size, bright and colorful. I can see plenty when visiting websites and it is always responsive.</p>
<p>STURDINESS: The phone is very sturdy. The plastic doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. The back cover locks securely, has never come undone on it’s own or anything like that and it doesn’t feel too light or fragile (not too heavy either) I’ve dropped it a few times and it has weathered all my clumsiness with good cheer. Yes I have experimentally dunked it in water (a few times!) after being OCD about making sure the back cover and usb port were covered, and the phone is perfectly fine. It amazed my friends, though at first they thought I had lost my mind. I have also used it in the rain while walking across campus and I use it in the shower everyday to listen to music. Yay!</p>
<p>CALLS/SPEAKER QUALITY: I have never had a problem with anyone hearing me during calls and I always hear them loud and clear. The speaker phone is lovely and no one has complained or even seemed to notice if I switch between normal and speaker (On an old phone I had, the speaker phone sounded staticky.) During calls the screen and white buttons on the front cycle through lighting up and turning off, saving battery life yet still allowing access to the dial pad/speakerphone buttons onscreen and the other apps/features on the phone. Since this is my first smart phone I was uneasy the 1st time I tried ending a call by closing the app only to realize I could still hear the other person. Yes you can just hit “End call” but I prefer a physical button. (I mean, what if I want to talk badly about them as soon as I hang up?) Just kidding! This was easily remedied by going into System Settings/Accessibility/ and choosing “Power button ends calls.”</p>
<p> Music plays loud and clear through both headphones and speaker phone and I think it’s nice that if I’m listening to music through headphones and they accidentally pull out of the jack, the music will not continue to play out loud. Might not seem like a big deal but it saves you some embarrassment when listening in the library or before a test in a quiet class room. I have no real complaints about the Google Play Music App that comes with the phone except sometimes it’ll start to play a song and it sounds all fuzzy. I just press back and then forward to restart the song and it plays fine. Weird, but doesn’t happen often.</p>
<p>TEXT MESSAGING/MAIL: I was worried to hear that companies are shifting away from physical keyboards since I didn’t have a great experience with my last touch screen phone (Samsung Solstice.) I’m a woman and even with my small hands everything ended up misspelled but the Hydro squashed all those fears.</p>
<p>I love the SWYPE keyboard that comes with the phone, very neat. Doesn’t take long to get used to (look for demo vids on Youtube.) I DO hate the way messaging displays the message I’m composing: I send long texts and no matter how long it is, your message is scrunched into this tiny box at the bottom (with the rest of the conversation shown above) and isn’t fully displayed at “real size” until you send it (WTF?) so you have to scroll back through and carefully proofread before sending. It does improve when turning the phone on it’s side to type, you see the whole thing.</p>
<p>CAMERA: I’ve used the camera to take quick shots to post on facebook. It could be user error but I dislike how every pic seems to come out looking dull and dark, and flash seems to make no difference at least when it’s displayed on the phone. When you first take a pic it looks fine but once it moves to the “Gallery” it seems to go dull and dark. BUT!: I might need to play with it more because the pics I posted on facebook look fine and true to their original colors(?)</p>
<p>MISC: The alarm is great, easy to set up and I haven’t run into a limit for how many you can have. I have 5 right now.</p>
<p>You can press the little microphone icon to enter text or search terms by speaking into the phone and I AM IMPRESSED. I have even searched for complex medical terms while doing homework and it has “heard” me accurately every time!</p>
<p>WIFI: I’m able to pick up a signal everywhere so far and I’ve had data and calls (clear) go through even with only the tiniest bar showing (of course it’s slower.) I don’t like that if I turn off the WIFI manually in Settings the phone will “restart,” turning off and turning back on again. That might just be how these phones work and it only takes a few seconds but it’s annoying. Happens rarely though; I only turn it off when the phone is determined to use the weak WIFI signal nearby and I tire of waiting for it to give up and switch to the Boost network.</p>
<p>BATTERY LIFE: Smart phones usually eat batteries for breakfast. The Hydro isn’t bad though; it comes with an Eco Mode app which is helpful and you can search for lots of other power-saving apps. I can go about 1 full day without charging it if I don’t use the phone AT ALL. With normal use (music, checking email, surf a little internet) I charge it once a day. I can record a 5 hour lecture and it doesn’t use much battery. I have gotten to school an hour before lecture, with only 25% battery, hooked it up to my laptop (the usb cord comes with the phone) and managed to get it up to around 40-50% charged in 20-30 minutes. Biggest tip: Turn off Facebook’s auto updating/ sync. It’s a battery killer! The phone shows you in Settings which apps have been using the most battery in the past, what’s running now etc.</p>
<p>Sorry it’s so long but these were some of the concerns I had and couldn’t find the answers to when I was searching.                </p>
<h3>Kyocera Hydro review</h3>
<p>                                                             October 17, 2012                </p>

<p>                    As first time android phone user, I find this product very functional: accessible, battery life ok, key pad a little small, easy change from phone to apps to camera to email, etc.                </p>
