Las Vegas, Nevada (PRWEB) July 15, 2013<br/><br/>&#13;
Agents of America.ORG is proud to announce the launching of the Encompass Workplace Mental Health App, the first workplace mental health App for android devices.<br/><br/>&#13;
The Encompass Workplace Mental Health App is an essential tool for every employer, manager, supervisor, human resource professional and employee representative to mitigate the complex, costly and often tragic consequences of depression, anxiety and bipolar disorders in the workplace.<br/><br/>&#13;
Few employers realize the serious impact mental health conditions have on their workplace. Every year one in five employees will suffer from a mental health condition. Indeed mental health conditions are the leading cause of lost work days among workers between the ages of 18 and 45 resulting in significant financial loss to a business.<br/><br/>&#13;
In addition, new changes in the Americans with Disabilities Act make employers considerably more vulnerable to discrimination charges by an employee with a mental health condition (now defined as an Intellectual Disability by the ADA).<br/><br/>&#13;
Many of these costs and risks to an employer and the debilitating consequences of mental illness to an employee can be mitigated by implementing simple, inexpensive mental health strategies in the workplace.<br/><br/>&#13;
This free App provides employers with valuable information on how to create a more mental health receptive work environment, how to manage a mental health emergency, videos on issues of workplace mental health, “How To Tips” on topics such as avoiding disability discrimination charges, and supporting a veteran with PTSD, assessment tools, local resource directory and so much more…….<br/><br/>&#13;
Agents of America strongly encourages all insurance agents and brokers serving the business community to pass on this vital information about the Encompass App to your clients as both a valuable service to your community and to raise your profile as a supporter of this important cause.<br/><br/>&#13;
The Encompass Workplace Mental Health program was first developed by the Greater Cincinnati Behavioral Health Services through a grant from the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati. GCBHS has a 30 year history of developing effective work strategies for individuals with mental health problems. GCBHS is the largest provider of mental health services in the Greater Cincinnati area.<br/><br/>&#13;
The Mental Health at Work App was developed by eMETA Learning Solutions. To download the Workplace Mental Health Application click here.<br/><br/>&#13;
